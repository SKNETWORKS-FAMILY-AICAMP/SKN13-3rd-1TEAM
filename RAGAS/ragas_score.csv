A multiplex PCR assay was also used to screen for carbapenemases and <i>mcr</i>-1 to -5 resistance genes. Efflux-pump inhibitors were used to evaluate efflux activity. The resistome, mobilome, epigenome, and transcriptome were characterized. There was phenotypic resistance to 22 of the 25 antibiotics tested, intermediate resistance to levofloxacin and nalidixic acid, and susceptibility to tigecycline, which corresponded to the 27 resistance genes found in the genome, most of which occurred in multiple copies through replicative transposition.

Types I and II methylases and restriction endonucleases were in close synteny to these resistance genes within the genomic islands; chromosomal genomic islands aligned with known plasmids. There was a closer evolutionary relationship between the strain and global strains but not local or regional strains; the resistomes also differed. Significantly expressed/repressed genes (6.2%) included resistance genes, hypothetical proteins, mobile elements, methyltransferases, transcription factors, and membrane and efflux proteins.

However, understanding of its resistance mechanisms to certain drug classes remains limited. This study focused on four bacterial strains (AB863, AB889, AB930, and AB960) exhibiting carbapenem resistance. They demonstrated high minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) (128\u2009mg/L) to meropenem and were categorized as extensively drug-resistant strains. Subsequently, they were identified as <i>A. baumannii</i> through 16S rRNA gene sequence analysis and species-specific PCR targeting the <i>bla</i><sub>OXA51</sub>-like gene. Three strains were sequenced for their genomes to study the genetic determinants and functional relevance of carbapenem resistance. The draft genome length of the strains ranged from 3.8 to 4.0 Mbp. A total of 16 antibiotic resistance genes including the genes <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> and <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-66</sub> which mediate carbapenem resistance were identified in the genomes. A comprehensive multilocus sequence typing analysis involving 95 <i>A. baumannii</i> strains from different Asian countries assigned the four strains to sequence type 2 (ST2), the most predominant ST circulating in Asia. Comparative genome analysis also revealed <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-66</sub> as the most dominant variant of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-51</sub>-like gene and also a widespread distribution of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> gene. In addition, various mobile genetic elements associated with AMR genes and three efflux pumps families were detected in the genomes of the strains. Transformation of <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-23</sub> and <i>bla</i><sub>OXA-66</sub> genes resulted in meropenem resistance in the transformant which exhibited a MIC of 2\u2009mg/L, thus confirming direct involvement of both genes in carbapenem resistance.']","ICU 환자에게서 분리된 Acinetobacter baumannii의 항생제 내성에 영향을 주는 주요 기전은 다음과 같습니다.

Pathogens such as <i>Escherichia coli</i>, <i>Salmonella</i> spp., and <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> can be transmitted to humans through direct contact, contaminated food, and environmental pathways, establishing a clear link between livestock farming and human AMR outbreaks. These challenges are particularly pronounced in regions with limited veterinary oversight and weak regulatory frameworks.

In order to identify appropriate solutions to the rise of antimicrobial resistance, it is imperative that we have a comprehensive understanding of the disease dynamics underpinning the ways in which antimicrobial resistance is transmitted between humans and animals. Furthermore, in consideration of the anticipated requirement to satisfy the global demand for food, it is imperative that we guarantee that resistance is not transmitted or propagated during the treatment and disposal of animal waste, particularly from intensive farming.

Functional pathway analysis suggested that indoor bacterial communities may harbor metabolic functions, as well as antibiotic resistance and virulence-related pathways, pointing to potential health concerns. Principal component analysis (PCA) showed clear distinctions between airborne and surface-deposited bacterial communities.

We assessed various parameters, including survival patterns, antibiotic resistance, vulnerability to ciliate predation, bacterial antagonism, and motility. Despite the minimal incidence of patient infections during our observation, environmental P. aeruginosa was prevalent throughout the hospital during our study. Clinical strains exhibited diminished resistance to certain antibiotics, increased resistance against ciliate predators, and enhanced swarming and swimming motility compared to their environmental counterparts. Clinical strains maintained higher cell densities under starvation conditions but were outcompeted by environmental strains in a nutrient medium.

However, minimal research exists on the bidirectional dissemination of ARGs in the soil-earthworm ecosystems under microplastic stress. Focusing on the typical microplastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microspheres in simulated soil-earthworm (Eisenia fetida) systems, we characterized the PVC-triggered interactive transmission of ARGs between earthworm guts and their dwelling soils using shotgun metagenomics and qPCR methodologies. PVC exposure did not alter the diversity and relative abundance of ARGs in earthworm-uninoculated soils but significantly increased those in earthworm-inoculated soils. Meanwhile, the abundance of ARGs increased in the earthworm gut under PVC stress. Source tracking analysis showed a higher source proportion of soil-borne ARGs into earthworm gut under PVC treatments. Mechanistically, PVC-triggered increasing prevalence of ARGs was significantly related to both the bacterial community and mobile genetic elements-mediated horizontal transfer in the soils, whereas the bacterial community predominated the process in the earthworm guts. Overall, our findings reveal a PVC-triggered bidirectional transmission pattern of ARGs between earthworm guts and their dwelling soils and highlight the overlooked ecotoxicological risk of microplastics in soil-earthworm systems.', 'This study examined the effects of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) nanoplastics on the rhizosphere of Oryza sativa L., focusing on dynamic changes and interactions among microbial communities, antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) and microplastic degradation genes (MDGs). PET exposure altered the structure and function of soil microbial, enabling specific microbial groups to thrive in polluted environments. High-dose PET treatments markedly increased the abundance and dissemination of ARGs, primarily via resistance mechanisms such as antibiotic efflux and target alteration. By providing additional carbon sources and surfaces for microbial attachment, PET stimulated the growth of microorganisms harboring MDGs, resulting in an increase in MDGs abundance. The elevated expression of MDGs facilitated the propagation of ARGs, with overlapping host microorganisms suggesting that certain microbial groups exhibit dual metabolic capabilities, enabling them to endure both antibiotic and microplastic pressures. Toxic byproducts of microplastic degradation, such as mono-ethylhexyl phthalate, further promoted ARGs dissemination by increasing horizontal gene transfer frequency. Structural equation modeling revealed that PET indirectly influenced ARGs and MDGs expression by altering soil C/N ratio, available phosphorus, and enzyme activities. Thus, nanoscale PET exacerbates ecological risks to soil microbial communities by driving co-propagation of ARGs and MDGs, highlighting the persistent threat of composite pollution to agroecosystems.']","PVC 미세플라스틱 노출은 지렁이가 없는 토양에서는 ARGs의 다양성과 상대적 풍부도에 영향을 미치지 않았으나, 지렁이가 있는 토양에서는 ARGs의 다양성과 상대적 풍부도를 유의미하게 증가시켰습니다.","PVC 노출은 지렁이가 접종되지 않은 토양에서 ARGs의 다양성과 상대적 풍부도에 영향을 주지 않았지만, 지렁이가 접종된 토양에서는 이들을 유의하게 증가시켰습니다.",0.9999999999,1.0,1.0,0.7650690380392403

Our experimental results reveal limitations in fluorescence spectroscopy for detecting photoreactivated bacteria, as the intense fluorescence of tryptophan and tyrosine amino acids masks the fluorescence emitted by thymine molecules. Conversely, Raman spectroscopy proves more effective, showing a detectable decrease in band intensities of E.\u2009coli bacteria at 1248 and 1665\u2009cm<sup>-1</sup> after exposure to UVC radiation. Subsequent UVA irradiation results in the partial restoration of these band intensities, indicating DNA repair and bacterial photoreactivation.

The ultraviolet (UV) system is a tertiary treatment strategy increasingly applied worldwide, although many studies have shown that disinfected effluent can still contain antibiotic-resistant bacteria and resistance genes. Therefore, to better understand the effects of UV radiation doses on the removal of all resistance elements (antibiotics, antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and antibiotic resistance genes), the present study was designed using a pilot-scale photoreactor. The UV doses could be varied to investigate whether there is an optimal UV dose capable of removing all resistance elements and also if the UV dose frequently applied in full-scale systems is able to reduce the resistance elements.

However, minimal research exists on the bidirectional dissemination of ARGs in the soil-earthworm ecosystems under microplastic stress. Focusing on the typical microplastic polyvinyl chloride (PVC) microspheres in simulated soil-earthworm (Eisenia fetida) systems, we characterized the PVC-triggered interactive transmission of ARGs between earthworm guts and their dwelling soils using shotgun metagenomics and qPCR methodologies. PVC exposure did not alter the diversity and relative abundance of ARGs in earthworm-uninoculated soils but significantly increased those in earthworm-inoculated soils. Meanwhile, the abundance of ARGs increased in the earthworm gut under PVC stress. Source tracking analysis showed a higher source proportion of soil-borne ARGs into earthworm gut under PVC treatments. Mechanistically, PVC-triggered increasing prevalence of ARGs was significantly related to both the bacterial community and mobile genetic elements-mediated horizontal transfer in the soils, whereas the bacterial community predominated the process in the earthworm guts. Overall, our findings reveal a PVC-triggered bidirectional transmission pattern of ARGs between earthworm guts and their dwelling soils and highlight the overlooked ecotoxicological risk of microplastics in soil-earthworm systems.', 'Animal-derived antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) have emerged as a critical threat, while vermicomposting has been recognized as an effective strategy for reducing ARGs.

Approximately 28 ARG types were detected in gut and vermicompost samples. There were significant differences in ARGs among the four species of earthworm composting systems (p\xa0<\xa00.05), and each species possessed its dominant ARGs and microbes. Proteobacteria represented the predominant bacterial phylum within the gut microbiota of Pheretima guillelmi (46.89\xa0%) and Eisenia fetida (48.42\xa0%), whereas Euryarchaeota (36.71\xa0%) and Actinobacteria (39.42\xa0%) were the most abundant in Perionyx excavatus and Eudrilus eugeniae, respectively. The overall abundance of ARGs in vermicompost processed by Eisenia fetida (0.18 copies16S rRNA gene copies) was lower than that observed in other earthworm species (0.23-0.39 copies/16S rRNA gene copies), with gut microbial identified as a key determinant of variations in ARG reduction.

Here we assessed Escherichia coli strain-sharing and overlap of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) across humans, poultry, canines, soil, and drinking water within and between households in urban informal settlements in Nairobi, Kenya. We collected 321 samples from 50 households with half having access to chlorinated water. We performed Pooling Isolated Colonies-seq, which sequences pools of up to five E. coli colonies per sample to capture strain diversity. Pooling Isolated Colonies-seq captured 1,516 colonies and identified 154 strain-sharing events, overcoming limitations of single-isolate sequencing and metagenomics. Within households, strain-sharing rates and resistome similarities across sample types were strongly correlated, suggesting clonal transmission of ARGs. E. coli isolated from the environment carried clinically relevant ARGs. Strain-sharing was rare between animals and humans but frequent between humans and drinking water. E. coli-contaminated stored drinking water was associated with higher human-human strain-sharing within households. These results suggest that contaminated drinking water facilitates human to human strain-sharing, and water treatment can disrupt transmission.', 'Contaminated household water in peri-urban communities is a reservoir for virulent Escherichia coli, but its role in the environmental transmission of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) remains poorly understood. This study characterized E. coli from household water and additionally aimed to investigate the transmissibility of ARGs from drug-resistant isolates. Twenty-five E. coli isolates from thirteen household well water sources were tested for resistance to 14 antibiotics by disc diffusion and whole-genome sequenced using the Illumina platform. The ARGs and plasmid replicon types were respectively predicted using ResFinder and PlasmidFinder. Multidrug-resistant strains carrying plasmid replicons found in unrelated strains were conjugated with nalidixic acid-resistant (NALR) E. coli C600 using the solid plate method.

Approaches such as ketogenic diets, fasting, sartans, and vitamin D supplementation have shown promise in providing similar benefits to CSs while mitigating the risks associated with the mechanisms identified as contributing to tumor progression. This perspective underscores the necessity for a reevaluation of CSs use in cancer care and advocates for further research into safer, more effective therapeutic strategies.', 'Sunitinib (SUN), a drug used to treat advanced renal cell carcinoma and other cancers, causes cardiotoxicity. This study aimed to identify a potential drug candidate to counteract SUN-induced cardiotoxicity. We analysed real-world data from adverse event report databases of existing clinically approved drugs to identify potential candidates. Through in silico analyses and in vitro experiments, the mechanisms of action were determined. The study identified calcitriol (CTL), an active form of vitamin D, as a promising candidate against SUN-induced cardiotoxicity. In H9c2 cells, SUN decreased cell viability significantly, whereas CTL mitigated this effect significantly. The SUN-treated group exhibited increased autophagy in H9c2 cells, which was reduced significantly in the CTL group. Bioinformatics analysis using Ingenuity Pathway Analysis revealed the mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) as a common factor between autophagy and CTL. Notably, rapamycin, an mTOR inhibitor, nullified the effects of CTL on cell viability and autophagy. Furthermore, SUN treatment led to significant reductions in cardiomyocyte diameters and increases in their widths, changes that were inhibited by CTL. SUN also induced morphological changes in surviving H9c2 cells, causing them to adopt a rounded shape, whereas CTL improved their morphology to resemble the elongated shape of the control group. In conclusion, the findings of the present study suggest that CTL has the potential to prevent SUN-induced cardiomyocyte damage through autophagy, particularly via mTOR-mediated pathways. The findings indicate that CTL could serve as an effective prophylactic agent against SUN-induced cardiotoxicity, offering a promising avenue for further research and potential clinical applications.']","코르티코스테로이드의 장기 사용은 암 환자의 생존에 부정적인 영향을 미치고 종양 진행을 악화시킬 수 있습니다. 이러한 부작용에는 포도당과 글루타민 대사의 증가, 비타민 D 수치의 교란, 그리고 마이크로바이옴의 변화가 주요 요인으로 작용합니다.",코르티코스테로이드의 장기 사용은 환자의 생존에 부정적인 영향을 미치고 종양 진행을 악화시킬 수 있습니다.,0.9999999999,1.0,1.0,0.8992522086407173

It is unclear whether community AMR is driven by overall antibiotic use or by high levels of repeated (intense) use by individual patients.', 'The growing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria within the human microbiome has become a pressing global health crisis. While antibiotics have revolutionized medicine by significantly reducing mortality and enabling advanced medical interventions, their misuse and overuse have led to the emergence of resistant bacterial strains. Key resistance mechanisms include genetic mutations, horizontal gene transfer, and biofilm formation, with the human microbiota acting as a reservoir for antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs). Industrialization and environmental factors have exacerbated this issue, contributing to a rise in infections with multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria, such as methicillin-resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) and carbapenem-resistant <i>Enterobacteriaceae</i>. These resistant pathogens compromise the effectiveness of essential treatments like surgical prophylaxis and chemotherapy, increase healthcare costs, and prolong hospital stays.

What biomarker is used to indicate low-grade inflammation in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity in this study?,"['Low-grade inflammation, indicated by elevated serum high-sensitivity CRP (hS-CRP), is commonly observed in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity. This study evaluated serum hS-CRP in relation to body fat parameters, lifestyle characteristics, and potential biological determinants (leptin, HDL cholesterol, and 25-OH vitamin D) in a Belgian population.', '<b>Background/Objectives</b>: Intestinal dysbiosis and systemic inflammation are involved in the pathophysiology of obesity and its complications. Presepsin is a recently discovered inflammation marker, being the soluble form of the bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor. Due to the imbalance of the gut flora and subsequent disruption of the intestinal barrier, circulating LPS levels have been found to be elevated in patients with metabolic diseases, even in the absence of infection. However, to date, no studies have evaluated whether obesity is associated with elevated presepsin levels. <b>Methods</b>: The present study included 81 participants (61.7% women, 27 with obesity, 34 with overweight, and 20 controls with normal body mass index), all free of infection and diabetes mellitus. Presepsin was measured in serum by ELISA, and its concentrations were compared between the groups. <b>Results</b>: The obesity group had higher presepsin levels compared to controls (8.09 vs. 4.45 ng/mL, <i>p</i> = 0.06). When participants with a history of cardiovascular disease were excluded from the analysis and adjusting for multiple confounders through a regression model, the obesity group had higher presepsin values than the overweight and control groups (5.84 vs. 3.32 ng/mL, <i>p</i> = 0.016). In contrast, the overweight group had lower concentrations than both the obesity group (<i>p</i> = 0.005) and the controls (<i>p</i> = 0.031). We did not find an association between presepsin and 25-hydroxy vitamin D levels (<i>p</i> = 0.368). <b>Conclusions</b>: Although the cross-sectional character of the study cannot demonstrate causal relationships, the results could potentially suggest that systemic inflammation is implicated in the pathogenesis of obesity through the disruption of the intestinal barrier. However, the findings should only be seen as hypothesis-generating. The reduction in presepsin in the overweight state is an interesting finding that deserves further investigation.']",이 연구에서 과체중 또는 비만인 아동 청소년에서 저강도 염증을 나타내는 지표로는 혈청 고감도 CRP(hS-CRP)가 사용되었습니다.,Serum high-sensitivity CRP (hS-CRP) is used to indicate low-grade inflammation in children and adolescents with overweight or obesity in this study.,0.9999999999,1.0,1.0,0.930982456295931

What is the current definition of a postbiotic?,"['The current definition of a postbiotic is a ""preparation of inanimate microorganisms and/or their components that confers a health benefit on the host"". Postbiotics can be mainly classified as metabolites, derived from intestinal bacterial fermentation, or structural components, as intrinsic constituents of the microbial cell. Secondary bile acids deoxycholic acid (DCA) and lithocholic acid (LCA) are bacterial metabolites generated by the enzymatic modifications of primary bile acids by microbial enzymes. Secondary bile acids function as receptor ligands modulating the activity of a family of bile-acid-regulated receptors (BARRs), including GPBAR1, Vitamin D (VDR) receptor and RORγT expressed by various cell types within the entire human body. Secondary bile acids integrate the definition of postbiotics, exerting potential beneficial effects on human health given their ability to regulate multiple biological processes such as glucose metabolism, energy expenditure and inflammation/immunity. Although there is evidence that bile acids might be harmful to the intestine, most of this evidence does not account for intestinal dysbiosis. This review examines this novel conceptual framework of secondary bile acids as postbiotics and how these mediators participate in maintaining host health.', ""Bacterial infections are a major global public health challenge, especially with increasing antibiotic resistance. Postbiotics, bioactive compounds produced by probiotics, have been proposed as a novel strategy to inhibit the growth of pathogenic bacteria and address antibiotic resistance. Similar to probiotics and certain food ingredients, postbiotics can also modulate beneficial microbial communities and ultimately contribute to host health. Postbiotics derived from probiotics may affect the physical and chemical conditions of the intestinal environment, and by enhancing the host's immune system, directly interfere with the metabolic pathways and signaling of pathogenic bacteria. Postbiotics inhibit biofilm formation, reduce the expression of antibiotic resistance genes, and enhance the efficacy of antibiotic therapies. They are effective against resistant bacteria such as Escherichia coli and Clostridium difficile and reduce the risk of dental infections caused by Streptococcus mutans. Some postbiotics, such as lactic acid and antimicrobial peptides derived from Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium genus, help the immune system dealing resistant bacteria such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus, and Helicobacter pylori.

In this study, we explored the protective effects of pelargonidin-3-<i>O</i>-galactoside (Pg3gal) on <i>Klebsiella pneumoniae</i> (KP)-induced ALI and its underlying mechanisms. Our findings indicated that Pg3gal mitigated lung histopathological changes and edema by inhibiting the migration and infiltration of immune cells and by reducing the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines. Molecular docking and surface plasmon resonance analyses revealed that Pg3gal bound to CD38 with high affinity. Further investigation showed that Pg3gal downregulated CD38 expression by promoting its ubiquitination. The reduction of CD38 elevated NAD<sup>+</sup> levels and SIRT1 expression and inhibited NF-κB p65 acetylation, thereby suppressing NLRP3 inflammasome-mediated pyroptosis.

Our results indicated that PM2.5 resulted in inflammation and oxidative stress, which in turn caused pathological damage and collagen deposition of lung tissue. In addition, exposure to PM2.5 increased TGF-β1 protein expression and Smad3 phosphorylation both in cells and in lung tissue, which involved collapse of antioxidant reduction system and degradation of SnoN. Additionally, in order to explored potential mechanisms, we used MG132 and VC pretreated cells and found that MG132 and VC pretreatment both inhibited ROS production, and increased SnoN protein expression levels. Further testing of EMT related indicators revealed that MG132 and VC pretreatment reversed the changes under PM2.5 exposure. Moreover, MG132 pretreatment reversed the increase of TGF-β1 protein expression and the Smad3 phosphorylation induced by PM2.5, but the effects were not as strong as those of VC pretreatment, which was related to the fact that VC inhibited both ROS production and SnoN degradation, which further clarifies the key role of ROS and SnoN in PM2.5-induced EMT.

While the invention of entirely new drugs to combat MRSA infection seems almost impossible, potentiating the efficacy of conventional antibiotics is critical. Our article explores the novel application of the antimalarial drug artesunate, which enhances the efficacy of vancomycin and cefoxitin in treating MRSA infections. We focused on Obg<sub>Sa</sub>, a conserved GTPase in MRSA, and found that artesunate selectively binds to its GTP-binding pocket. We further evaluated the GTP-binding activity and metal dependence (specifically, Mg<sup>2+</sup>) of this conserved GTPase. In silico analysis identified several threonine residues essential for GTP binding, which were subsequently mutated to assess their role in GTP binding. As shown in the analysis, these mutations significantly impacted both the GTP binding and hydrolysis functions of Obg<sub>Sa</sub>. Notably, these threonine residues were also crucial for artesunate binding within the GTP-binding domain. When the effect of artesunate was assessed, the drug competitively inhibited GTP binding and hydrolysis of the GTPase. This result was manifested as reduced antibiotic tolerance, disruption of biofilms, and a decrease in persister cells─critical factors in chronic infections. In summary, our research presents an innovative strategy to combat antimicrobial resistance through artesunate, highlighting its potential effectiveness in eradicating infections.', 'Methicillin resistant <i>Staphylococcus aureus</i> (MRSA) sepsis has a high rate of morbidity and mortality.

We report a serendipitous observation revealed a phenotype where MRSA became sensitive to cefazolin when cultured in a physiologic relevant media of fetal bovine serum as well as in synovial fluid. This could be observed across multiple clinical isolates. Expected resistance was maintained when cultured in Muller Hinton Broth (MHB). MRSA β-lactam antibiotic resistance is mediated by PBP2a, a penicillin-binding protein encoded by <i>mecA</i> . We hypothesized that this phenotype of antibiotic sensitivity in physiologic medium was based, in part, on levels of PBP2a expression and post-translational modifications of peptidoglycan wall teichoic acid (WTA).

Genomic characterization provides deeper insight into its potential health benefits and safety profile.', 'Probiotics play crucial roles in promoting gut health, enhancing immunity, and combating pathogenic microorganisms, with increasing interest in their applications in the food and therapeutic industries. Lactococcus lactis, a well-known lactic acid bacterium, has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its probiotic traits and safety profile. In this study, we investigated the probiotic potential and genomic profile of Lactococcus lactis SK2-659, a strain isolated from Thai fermented green mustard (Pak-kad-dong). Genomic analysis revealed numerous genes associated with probiotic traits, including stress tolerance, adhesion, and antimicrobial activity, with a particular focus on bacteriocin SK2-659, which was effective against pathogenic bacteria such as Helicobacter pylori. The bacteriocin produced by L. lactis SK2-659, identified as nisin Z, disrupts bacterial membranes via pore formation, leading to cell lysis. Metabolomic profiling further highlighted its ability to increase carbohydrate and amino acid metabolism, supporting cell growth and survival in acidic environments. Also, amino acid metabolism (elevated tryptophan, tyrosine, histidine) supports acid tolerance and immune modulation. Tryptophan metabolism produces indole derivatives, which are known to benefit gut health and immunity. Additionally, strain SK2-659 demonstrated strong tolerance to gastrointestinal conditions, high adhesion capacity to intestinal cells, and immunomodulatory effects, contributing to gut health. Safety assessments confirmed the absence of virulence factors, pathogenic traits, and antibiotic resistance genes, along with a lack of biogenic amine production, underscoring its suitability for food and health applications. These findings establish L. lactis SK2-659 as a promising probiotic candidate with potential industrial applications in functional foods, food preservation, and therapeutic products. Given its probiotic properties, antimicrobial activity, and safety profile, this strain is particularly suited for the food industry as a functional food ingredient and natural bio-preservative, as well as the healthcare and pharmaceutical industries for use in therapeutic probiotics and gut health formulations.']",Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is valuable for food and clinical applications because of its probiotic and antimicrobial properties.,Lactiplantibacillus plantarum is valued for its probiotic and antimicrobial properties.,0.9999999999,1.0,1.0,0.9462589546282064
Why do patient transfers between hospital departments pose a risk?,"['Patient transfers occur frequently between hospital departments and wards, and bring with them the risk of interdepartmental transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB). These bacteria form a risk to patients already susceptible to colonization and infection.', 'Hospitals are high risk areas for the spread of diseases, with indoor bioaerosols containing a variety of pathogens. Inhalation of these pathogens may cause severe nosocomial infections in patients and medical staff. A comprehensive investigation was conducted during the influenza A outbreak to explore the distribution and pathogenic risk of airborne pathogens and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) across different hospital departments. It was revealed that airborne bacterial concentrations ranged from 118 to 259\xa0CFU/m<sup>3</sup>, and the main aerosol particle size was 4.7-5.8\xa0μm (27.7\xa0%). The proportion of bioaerosols smaller than 2.5\xa0μm was highest in the respiratory waiting area (59.3\xa0%). The dominant pathogens detected in hospital air were Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Pseudomonas and Micrococcus. The absolute abundance of ARGs/mobile genetic elements (MGEs) ranged from 0.55 to 479.44 copies/m<sup>3</sup>, peaking in the respiratory ward air. TetL-02, lnuA-01, intI1, ermB, and qacEdelta1-02 were the top five ARGs/MGEs in hospital air. Moreover, doctors inhaled higher doses of ARGs/MGEs in inpatient wards than outpatient waiting areas. Network analysis identified Pseudomonas, Micrococcus, Microbacterium, and Enterobacter as potential ARGs reservoirs. The Bugbase result showed the presence of potentially pathogenic pathogens in the bioaerosols at all sampling sites. The quantitative microbiological risk assessment results further showed that airborne Staphylococcus could pose an infection risk to medical staff. It was determined that the use of masks was effective in reducing this risk to an acceptable level. This study will provide a scientific basis for comprehensively understanding the characteristics and potential risks of hospital bioaerosols during the outbreak of respiratory infectious diseases.']","환자들이 병원 내 부서 및 병동 간에 자주 이동하는데, 이로 인해 항생제 내성 세균(ARB)의 부서 간 전파 위험이 발생하기 때문입니다. 이러한 세균들은 이미 집락화나 감염에 취약한 환자들에게 위험을 초래합니다.","They pose a risk because they can lead to interdepartmental transmission of antibiotic-resistant bacteria (ARB), which threaten patients susceptible to colonization and infection.",0.99999999995,1.0,1.0,0.6041013603248032
S. Mbandaka의 IncHI2A/IncHI2 플라스미드에서 중국에서 처음으로 관찰된 항생제 내성 유전자는 무엇인가요?,"['Salmonella enterica serotype Mbandaka (S. Mbandaka), a multi-host adapted non-typhoidal Salmonella, has emerged as a significant public health concern in recent years. In this study, we isolated S. Mbandaka strains carrying a multidrug-resistant IncHI2A/IncHI2 plasmid from deceased chickens in China and performed whole-genome sequencing and comparative genomic analyses to investigate their global dissemination and evolutionary adaptation. The multidrug-resistant IncHI2A/IncHI2 plasmid in isolate YK35 harbored multiple antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) including bla<sub>OXA-10</sub>, which was firstly observed in S. Mbandaka in China. It exhibited high sequence identity with IncHI2A/IncHI2 plasmids identified in other bacterial species, including S. Typhimurium, Klebsiella aerogenes, and E. coli, which suggested the cross-species dissemination of IncHI2A/IncHI2 plasmids and ARGs. Global genomic epidemiology classified S. Mbandaka strains into seven distinct clades, with the majority originating from the USA and the UK. The pan-genomic analysis indicated an open pan-genome structure, with continuous expansion of accessory genes, particularly those associated with replication, recombination, repair, and defense mechanisms, underscoring the evolutionary adaptation of S. Mbandaka to external environments. Evolutionary analysis further traced the international transmission routes of S. Mbandaka, revealing potential cross-regional spread, particularly from the USA and the UK to other countries, including China. The findings emphasize the global spread and evolutionary adaptation of S. Mbandaka, likely driven by international trade and horizontal gene transfer, including the acquisition of ARGs, which have contributed to its increasing public health risks. This study underscores the urgent need for enhanced surveillance and control measures to mitigate the spread of S. Mbandaka and its antibiotic resistance, particularly in the context of global food supply chains and international trade.', '<i>tet</i>(X4)-positive IncHI1 plasmids are widely prevalent in various bacteria. To understand their transmission characteristics, we analyzed two extensively drug-resistant (XDR) <i>Escherichia coli</i> strains isolated from pet dog feces in Henan Province, China. Strain T28R harbored <i>tet</i>(X4)-positive IncHI1, IncF18:A-:B-, and <i>mcr-1</i>-positive IncI2 plasmids, while T16R carried <i>tet</i>(X4)-positive IncHI1, F16:A-:B-, and <i>mcr-1</i>-positive IncX4 plasmids. Four representative fusion plasmids, pT28R-F1, pT28R-F2, pT28R-F3, and pT16R-F1, in transconjugants were analyzed using WGS and PCR mapping. The results showed that IS<i>26</i> from the IncF18:A-:B--plasmid attacked the conjugative transfer-associated genes <i>trhc</i> and <i>rsp</i> on the IncHI1 plasmid, generating pT28R-F1 and pT28R-F2. pT28R-F3 was generated through IS<i>Cro1</i>- and IS<i>CR2</i>-mediated homologous recombination, deleting the Tra1 region of the IncHI1 plasmid. T16R-F1 emerged from IS<i>CR2</i>- and IS<i>1B</i>-mediated homologous recombination, losing transfer regions of parental plasmids. Notably, fusion plasmids lost the temperature sensitivity of the IncHI1 plasmid, with conjugation frequencies between 1.57 × 10<sup>-4</sup> and 3.84 × 10<sup>-5</sup> at 28 °C and 37 °C. The findings suggest that <i>tet</i>(X4)-positive IncHI1 plasmids could be mobilized with the assistance of conjugative helper plasmids and that fusion events enhance the adaptability of these plasmids, thus facilitating the spread of antibiotic resistance, posing a growing public health threat.']",S.

VD 부족이 PCC 환자에게 미치는 영향은 무엇입니까?,"['Vitamin D (VD) levels are closely related to the occurrence of post-COVID-19 conditions (PCCs), but the specific mechanism is still unclear. Here, a total of 50 PCC patient serum samples were divided into the VD sufficient group (VD ≥ 30 ng/mL), the VD insufficient group (20 ng/mL ≤ VD < 30 ng/mL), and the VD deficiency group (VD < 20 ng/mL) and then subjected to proteomic analysis. We identified 15 differential abundance proteins (DAPs) between the VD sufficient and VD insufficient groups, including 5 immunoglobulin proteins (JCHAJN, IGHV4-28, GHV4-34, IGHM, and IGLV2-11), which were significantly negatively correlated with VD levels in PCC patients. These DAPs were primarily enriched in immune-related pathways such as the TNF signaling pathway and the B cell receptor signaling pathway. Compared with the VD insufficient group, VD deficiency resulted in 4 proteins being upregulated and 8 proteins being downregulated. The declined abundance of IGLV1-47 negatively correlated with serum VD levels. Albumin (ALB) was in the center of the protein-protein interaction (PPI) network map of all DAPs and was negatively correlated with serum VD levels. In conclusion, VD insufficiency/deficiency leads to abnormalities in immunoglobulin heavy, light, and J chains, resulting in PCC syndrome. VD supplementation may be a potential therapeutic strategy to alleviate the symptoms of PCC.', 'Vitamin D deficiency (VDD) is a worldwide pandemic.
