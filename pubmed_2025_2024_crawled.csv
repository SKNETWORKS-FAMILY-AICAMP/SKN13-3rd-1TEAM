AB  - Naturally competent bacteria can be engineered into platforms for detecting 
      environmental DNA. This capability could be used to monitor the spread of 
      pathogens, invasive species, and resistance genes, among other applications. 
      Here, we create Acinetobacter baylyi ADP1-ISx biosensors that detect specific 
      target DNA sequences through natural transformation. We tested strains with DNA 
      sensors that consisted of either a mutated antibiotic resistance gene (TEM-1 bla 
      or nptII) or a counterselectable gene flanked by sequences from the fungus 
      Pseudogymnoascus destructans, which causes white-nose syndrome in bats. Upon 
      uptake of homologous DNA, recombination restored antibiotic resistance gene 
      function or removed the counterselectable gene, enabling selection of cells that 
      sensed the target DNA. The antibiotic resistance gene and P. destructans 
      biosensors could detect as few as 3,000 or 5,000,000 molecules of their DNA 
      targets, respectively, and their sensitivity was not affected by excess 
      off-target DNA. These results demonstrate how A. baylyi can be reprogrammed into 
      a modular platform for monitoring environmental DNA.

AB  - The invasion of moso bamboo significantly alters aboveground vegetation, yet its 
      impact on soil microbial communities and associated ecological functions remains 
      under-explored. To address this knowledge gap, we conducted a comprehensive 
      survey across 24 sites spanning varying invasion gradients (non-invaded, 
      half-invaded, fully-invaded) along an urbanization transect encompassing 
      mountain, rural, suburban, and urban habitats. Our results reveal that bamboo 
      invasion strengthens deterministic processes governing microbial community 
      assembly. Fungal communities demonstrated stronger deterministic assembly 
      patterns compared to bacteria and served as more reliable bio-indicators of 
      invasion stages, as assessed via random forest modeling. Notably, moso bamboo 
      presence correlated with elevated soil concentrations of antibiotic resistance 
      genes (ARGs) and virulence factors (VFs). Rural sites exhibited atypical trends, 
      potentially due to intrinsically high baseline levels of ARGs and VFs. Structural 
      equation modeling clarified that bamboo invasion induces shifts in soil 
      physicochemical properties, which in turn drive deterministic selection of 
      microbial taxa harboring ARGs/VFs-including potential human pathogens. 
      Essentially, restoration of bamboo-dominated ecosystems effectively reduced the 
      abundance of these resistance and virulence elements. Co-occurrence network 
      analyses further identified microbial taxa with pathogen-lysis capabilities, 
      highlighting natural biological control mechanisms within invaded soils. This 
      study deepens understanding of how moso bamboo invasion remodels soil microbiomes 
      and their functional profiles, providing actionable insights for mitigating 
      ecological risks linked to invasive plant dynamics.

AB  - Microplastics are a growing concern worldwide because of their impact on the 
      environment and human health. Composting is an effective method for managing 
      antibiotic resistome risk in organic waste, yet the effects of microplastics on 
      antibiotic resistome risk in composting are not well understood. In this study of 
      laying hen manure, the microplastic polypropylene increased the temperature of 
      the compost but did not significantly affect the total composition, abundance and 
      risk score of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) during composting. The dominant 
      phyla on microplastics and manure were Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and 
      Proteobacteria. Escherichia (bin.70), Oceanobacillus (bin.85) and Mycobacterium 
      (bin.79) were the main ARG hosts. Among them, the abundance of the ARG host 
      Mycobacterium (bin.79) was significantly higher in microplastics than in manure. 
      Furthermore, ARG transfer occurred between the ARG host Mycobacterium (bin.79) 
      and other microorganisms on microplastics and manure. These findings indicate 
      that while microplastics may not strongly affect the overall antibiotic resistome 
      risk during composting, they increase the likelihood of horizontal gene transfer 
      in specific ARG hosts. This underscores the critical need to control both 
      microplastic and resistance contamination.

AB  - Antibiotic resistance in foodborne bacteria is a growing public health concern, 
      particularly in fresh produce. This study evaluates multidrug-resistant bacteria 
      (MDRB) isolated from spoiled zucchini, cucumber, and potato collected from Sabia, 
      Abu Arish, and Samta in the Jazan region. Bacterial isolates were cultured on 
      MacConkey and Mannitol salt agar, followed by Gram staining to identify three 
      Gram-negative (KMcS, CMcA, PMcSa) and three Gram-positive (KMS, CMA, PMSa) 
      isolates. Antibiotic susceptibility testing was performed against Penicillin (P), 
      Streptomycin (S), Cefotaxime (CTX), Chloramphenicol (C), Ofloxacin (OF), and 
      Erythromycin (E). The inhibition zones varied across antibiotics, with Ofloxacin 
      exhibiting the largest inhibition zones (40-50 mm) and Cefotaxime and 
      Erythromycin showing the weakest inhibition (</=14 mm). The Resistance Index (RI), 
      which represents the proportion of antibiotics with no inhibition, ranged from 
      0.2 (moderate resistance) to 0.6 (high resistance in the PMcSa isolate). ANOVA (p 
       approximately  6.95e-08) confirmed significant differences in inhibition zones across 
      antibiotics, while Tukey's HSD test showed that Ofloxacin was significantly more 
      effective than both Cefotaxime (p = 0.0005) and Erythromycin (p = 0.0035). 
      Correlation analysis revealed strong positive associations between resistance to 
      Chloramphenicol, Streptomycin, and Ofloxacin (r > 0.7), suggesting potential 
      cross-resistance mechanisms. Hierarchical clustering and KMeans analysis (K=3) 
      grouped bacterial isolates based on their resistance patterns, while PCA 
      visualization distinguished Ofloxacin-sensitive and multidrug-resistant isolates. 
      The findings highlight an urgent need for targeted antibiotic stewardship 
      programs, especially in agricultural practices, to limit the overuse of 
      antibiotics. Additionally, enhanced sanitation measures during food handling and 
      real-time monitoring of bacterial contamination in the food supply chain could 
      significantly reduce the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria from farm to 
      table.

AB  - Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) is a highly pathogenic bacterium capable of 
      causing a range of infections in humans and animals, from minor skin lesions to 
      severe systemic diseases. The widespread use of antibiotics has exacerbated the 
      issue of antibiotic resistance, notably with the emergence of 
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), complicating treatment 
      strategies. This study investigated the potential of the natural compound 
      puerarin to inhibit key virulence factors of S. aureus, specifically coagulase 
      (Coa) and von Willebrand factor-binding protein (vWbp). Our results demonstrate 
      that puerarin effectively inhibits Coa- and vWbp-induced coagulation without 
      affecting bacterial growth. Cytotoxicity, invasion, and live/dead cell staining 
      assays further revealed the excellent biocompatibility of puerarin and its 
      ability to significantly reduce S. aureus-mediated cellular invasion and 
      cytotoxicity. Scanning electron microscopy of in vitro catheter models revealed a 
      marked reduction in bacterial adherence following puerarin treatment. 
      Fluorescence quenching, western blot, and thermal shift assays (TSAs) revealed 
      that puerarin does not alter the expression of Coa or vWbp but interacts directly 
      with these proteins, impairing their stability and activity. Molecular docking 
      and site-directed mutagenesis analyses identified critical residues in Coa and 
      vWbp essential for puerarin binding, which was confirmed through in vitro 
      coagulation assays. In a murine skin infection model, puerarin treatment 
      ameliorated S. aureus-induced tissue damage and accelerated wound healing. 
      Collectively, these findings highlight the therapeutic potential of puerarin as a 
      novel antivirulence agent against S. aureus, offering a promising strategy to 
      mitigate bacterial infections while addressing the challenge of antibiotic 
      resistance.

AB  - The coexistence of microplastics (MPs) and antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) in 
      various environments presents significant ecological risks. However, the 
      influence of MPs properties and environmental conditions shaping ARG dynamics 
      remain unclear. This study utilized meta- and interaction analysis to elucidate 
      how MPs properties (size, concentration, type, and age) and exposure environments 
      drive ARGs fluctuations. Key findings indicate that MPs significantly influenced 
      ARGs abundance in intestinal, sludge, and plant environments, no pronounced 
      effects were observed in soil or water and sediments. Among the MPs properties, 
      size and concentration were the most influential factors, with their impacts 
      varying considerably across environments. In intestinal settings, exposure time 
      and MPs concentration drove ARG proliferation; while the concentration-size 
      interactions of MPs shaped ARGs in sludge environments; MPs size was the primary 
      influencing factor in plant environments, reflecting unique ARG dynamics in these 
      contexts. The study also highlighted significant pairwise interactions, such as 
      MPs concentration and size, underscoring the combined effects of these factors on 
      ARG abundance. Despite these contributions, the study acknowledges limitations, 
      including the limited analysis of aerosolized ARGs and more diverse MPs 
      characteristics. These findings provide valuable insights into the ecological 
      risks of MPs and ARGs and emphasize the importance of tailored mitigation 
      strategies across different environments.

AB  - Bacteriophages are pivotal in shaping microbial communities, but their structural 
      and functional responses to antibiotic stress in aerobic biofilms remain 
      underexplored. This study aims to fill this void by providing a comprehensive 
      understanding of how viral communities in aerobic biofilms adapt to increasing 
      antibiotic pressures through interactions with their bacterial hosts. Three 
      lab-scale aerobic biofilm systems were established and operated for 577 days, two 
      of those were exposed to increasing influent concentrations of oxytetracycline 
      (OTC) and streptomycin (STM), respectively. The dynamics of the biofilm virome 
      under antibiotic stress was revealed by metagenomic sequencing. Results showed 
      that the virome in aerobic biofilms displayed a high percentage (98.7 %) of 
      unknown bacteriophages, indicating considerable viral diversity. As for the hosts 
      of phages, a total of 1741 bacteriophage contigs were associated with 660 
      distinct bacterial hosts. In antibiotic-treated systems, broad-host-range 
      generalist bacteriophages accounted for over 17.95 % (STM) and 17.90 % (OTC), 
      compared to 14.32 % in the control. Furthermore, viral community did not carry 
      diverse antibiotic resistance genes, which only accounted for 0.34 % of the 
      resistome. Additionally, it did not regulate the number of resistant bacteria by 
      activating the lytic and lysogenic cycles in this study. This indicated that the 
      contribution of transduction to the horizontal spread of resistant determinants 
      is very limited in the aerobic biofilm. Under antibiotic stress, viral auxiliary 
      metabolic genes compensated for incomplete metabolic pathways in host cells, 
      particularly those related to carbohydrate, amino acid, and cofactor metabolism. 
      These genes likely offer dual benefits to bacterial hosts by repairing 
      antibiotic-induced cellular damage and supporting energy generation, thereby 
      providing adaptive advantages for bacterial survival and proliferation under 
      antibiotic selection pressure. This study uncovers the complex interactions 
      between bacteriophages, their hosts, and environmental pressures. It suggests 
      that viral communities in these environments compensate for functional metabolism 
      rather than promote resistance development under antibiotic stress, providing new 
      insights into the potential roles of bacteriophages in the regulation of 
      microbial-driven processes.

      resistance genes.

AB  - The widespread overuse of antibiotics in mariculture poses significant 
      environmental and health risks. Membrane-aerated biofilm photoreactor (MABPR), 
      leveraging membrane aeration and microalgal-bacterial functionality, has 
      demonstrated potential for nitrogen and antibiotic removal from wastewater. 
      However, its application for antibiotic risk control under the high salinity and 
      low organic strength typical of mariculture effluents remains largely unexplored. 
      Co-metabolism, facilitated by co-substrate addition, has emerged as a promising 
      strategy for enhancing antibiotic mitigation under environmental stresses. Yet, 
      its effectiveness and underlying mechanisms in MABPR are not well understood. 
      This study evaluated the effectiveness of external co-substrate (sodium acetate) 
      supplementation for sulfamethoxazole (SMX) removal and control of antibiotic 
      resistance genes (ARGs) in MABPR treating mariculture effluents. Results 
      demonstrated that MABPR could achieve considerable SMX removal from mariculture 
      wastewater. Concurrently, the addition of co-substrate developed an active 
      ""energy conservation-metabolic enzyme machinery"" in MABPR, significantly 
      upregulating the expression of metabolic enzymes and energy conservation pathways 
      (up to 8.25-fold upregulation than control), with microalgae as the primary 
      contributors, thereby fostering metabolic functions and activities. This 
      enhancement significantly improved SMX removal efficiencies by 41.1 %-80.6 %, 
      while also enhancing system resilience even under high SMX loading. Concurrently, 
      co-substrate supplementation alleviated oxidative stress, reducing intracellular 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) levels by approximately 14 %. Total ARG abundance 
      decreased by 14.2-20.4 % under the co-substrate-amended condition. Transcriptomic 
      analysis revealed that co-substrate addition significantly upregulated 
      antioxidant defense systems while suppressing gene expression involved in the SOS 
      response and conjugative transfer. These transcriptomic changes showed 
      significant correlation with the ARG abundance reductions, suggesting that 
      co-substrate supplementation likely restricts ARG dissemination by modulating 
      cellular stress responses. Our findings not only highlight the potential of 
      external co-substrate supplementation for antibiotic risk mitigation during 
      mariculture wastewater treatment, but also provide unique insights into the 
      co-substrate-mediated underlying regulatory mechanisms for antibiotic risk 
      control in MABPR.

AB  - Shrimp pond aquaculture, like fish pond culture, faces significant challenges 
      such as water pollution and antibiotic resistance, driven by chemical overuse and 
      untreated effluent discharge. This study evaluates the efficacy of an ecological 
      treatment system in treating shrimp pond wastewater, focusing on water quality 
      improvement, microbial community dynamics, phytoplankton composition, and 
      antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) mitigation. Using adjacent river indicators as a 
      reference, comparative analyses were conducted on phytoplankton density and 
      biomass, key water quality parameters, and microbial parameters in shrimp culture 
      and ecological ponds across key growth stages and the pond cleaning period. 
      Bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequencing was employed to assess bacterial community 
      diversity and composition in water and sediment. Additionally, the abundance of 
      12 ARGs was quantified, and their correlations with bacterial communities were 
      analyzed. Results demonstrated that the ecological treatment system significantly 
      improved water quality, with the ecological pond consistently exhibiting lower 
      levels of key water quality parameters compared to the culture pond. 
      Phytoplankton density and biomass were highest in the culture pond, while the 
      ecological pond maintained intermediate levels, acting as an effective buffer. 
      Microbial analysis revealed reduced bacterial and coliform counts in the 
      ecological pond. ARG abundances were highest in the culture pond, whereas the 
      ecological pond showed marked reductions. Dynamic correlations between ARGs and 
      bacterial genera, such as Pseudomonas, were observed, highlighting the system's 
      potential to mitigate antibiotic resistance. This study underscores the 
      ecological treatment system's effectiveness in purifying shrimp pond wastewater, 
      reducing microbial contamination, and providing critical insights for system 
      optimization.

TI  - The ability of ozone to counteract multidrug-resistant bacteria if used as an 
      adjunct therapy: a bioinformatic modelling.
LID - 10.1099/jmm.0.002035 [doi]
AB  - Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria pose a growing threat to global health, 
      prompting exploration of alternative therapies. This study uses bioinformatic 
      modelling to assess ozone therapy as an adjunct treatment, analysing both linear 
      and non-linear (chaotic) frameworks. Results suggest that ozone exerts 
      bactericidal effects and modulates immune responses, partly through the 
      production of 4-hydroxynonenal. Simulations indicate that ozone-induced adaptive 
      chaos may enhance immune resilience and accelerate bacterial clearance compared 
      to antibiotics alone. However, the findings are theoretical, and the short 
      half-life of ozone limits direct impact, emphasizing the need for experimental 
      validation. Ozone therapy shows promise, but its role in adaptive chaos requires 
      further study to determine its clinical viability, despite a large number of 
      reports showing an undisputable action of medical ozone against MDR bacteria.

TI  - Global health risks lurking in livestock resistome.
PG  - eadt8073
LID - 10.1126/sciadv.adt8073 [doi]
AB  - Livestock farming consumes more than 70% of global antibiotics annually, making 
      livestock manures an important vector of anthropogenically influenced antibiotic 
      resistance genes (ARGs). The global pattern of the livestock resistome, its 
      driving mechanisms, and transmission potential to the clinic are not well 
      assessed. We analyzed 4017 livestock manure metagenomes from 26 countries and 
      constructed a comprehensive catalog of livestock ARGs and metagenome-assembled 
      genomes. Livestock resistome is a substantial reservoir of known (2291 subtypes) 
      and latent ARGs (3166 subtypes) and is highly connectable to human resistomes. We 
      depicted the global pattern of livestock resistome and prevalence of clinically 
      critical ARGs, highlighting the role of farm and human antibiotic stewardship in 
      shaping livestock resistome. We developed a risk-assessment framework by 
      integrating mobility potential, clinical significance, and host pathogenic 
      relevance, and prioritized higher risk livestock ARGs, producing a predictive 
      global map of livestock resistome risks that can help guide research and policy.

      eradicating the Helicobacter pylori causing gastritis.
PG  - 2601060251349878
LID - 10.1177/02601060251349878 [doi]
AB  - BackgroundGastritis, caused by Helicobacter pylori, is a major health concern 
      affecting nearly half of the global population and is linked to severe 
      gastrointestinal diseases, including gastric cancer. Despite available 
      treatments, increasing antibiotic resistance raises the risk of treatment 
      failure, highlighting the need for alternative therapies. Probiotics and 
      antioxidants, such as lycopene, have shown promise in managing H. pylori-related 
      gastric diseases.AimThis study conducts a systematic literature review (SLR) to 
      evaluate the potential of lycopene, enhanced through lactic acid bacteria (LAB) 
      fermentation of plant-based sources, in treating H. pylori-induced 
      gastritis.MethodologyUsing the PRISMA method, articles from Google Scholar, 
      Science Direct, and PubMed (2018-2025) were reviewed. Out of 279 papers analyzed, 
      30 met the inclusion criteria, focusing on lycopene production via LAB 
      fermentation and its efficacy against H. pylori.ResultsFindings indicate that LAB 
      fermentation enhances lycopene's bioavailability and stability, while certain LAB 
      strains exhibit inhibitory effects on H. pylori growth. Lycopene demonstrates 
      anti-carcinogenic properties, reducing oxidative stress and inflammation in 
      gastric cells without harming normal epithelial cells. However, its effectiveness 
      varies depending on fermentation conditions and bacterial strains.ConclusionThis 
      study underscores the potential of combining probiotics and lycopene as an 
      adjunct therapy for H. pylori infections, particularly amid antibiotic 
      resistance. Future research should optimize fermentation processes, identify the 
      most effective LAB strains, and conduct clinical trials to validate fermented 
      lycopene's therapeutic potential. This approach could offer a sustainable and 
      effective alternative to conventional antibiotic treatments.

LID - 10.1089/bfm.2025.0092 [doi]
AB  - Background: Mothers delivering preterm are very often exposed to antibiotics in 
      the peripartum period. We hypothesize this may select bacteria bearing antibiotic 
      resistance genes (ARGs) in the breast milk and be transmitted to the neonate's 
      mouth while feeding. This study aimed to determine the prevalence of ARGs coding 
      for extended-spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBLs) (including AmpC beta-lactamases 
      [ACBLs]) and carbapenemases in breast milk and neonatal oral swab samples of 
      preterm mother-infant pairs, the concordance of ARGs between paired samples, and 
      risk factors of ARGs coding for ESBLs and carbapenemases. Methods: Breast milk 
      and oral swab samples were obtained aseptically from 100 preterm mother-infant 
      pairs (gestation 28-34 weeks) by postpartum day 10. Multiplex PCR was used to 
      detect 15 common ARGs in these samples. Potential risk factors of the presence of 
      any ARG coding for ESBLs or carbapenemases in breast milk and oral swab samples 
      were studied. Results: The commonest ARGs for ESBLs, ACBLs, and carbapenemases in 
      breast milk were bla(SHV) (28%), bla(CIT) (33%), and bla(IMP) (49%), 
      respectively; and oral swabs bla(CTX-M1) (30%), bla(CIT) (58%), and bla(IMP) 
      (24%), respectively. ARGs common to breast milk and oral swabs included bla(CIT) 
      (13%), bla(IMP) (10%), bla(CTX-M-1) (9%), and bla(SHV) (6%). Formula milk intake 
      was associated with less oral carbapenemase ARGs. Conclusion: ARGs for ESBLs and 
      carbapenemases are highly prevalent in preterm breast milk and oral swabs.

TI  - Genetically Engineered Yeast for Enhanced Biodegradation of Beta-lactam Antibiotics.
LID - 10.1007/s12010-025-05291-4 [doi]
AB  - High environmental concentrations of pharmaceuticals, particularly antibiotics, 
      have been observed worldwide, while antibiotic concentrations in the ng/L to microg/L 
      range may adversely affect biota and contribute to the formation of antibiotic 
      resistance. The underlying causes of high environmental concentrations include, 
      in addition to the low rate of antibiotic' metabolization and the high rate of 
      usage, especially of beta-lactam antibiotics, the insufficient removal by 
      conventional wastewater treatment methods. Consequently, alternative methods need 
      to be developed to remove antibiotics from wastewater-one possibility is the use 
      of enzymes. In this study, the enzyme beta-lactamase was secreted by a genetically 
      modified yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) upon recognition of a pheromone 
      (alpha-factor) as inducer to enable the degradation of ampicillin. This represents a 
      crucial step on the road to a sensor-actuator system, allowing for the 
      development of an intelligent removal system that can react to the presence of 
      antibiotics. Ampicillin and its transformation products were studied by LC-MS/MS 
      measurements using a carbamoyl functionalized column under hydrophilic 
      interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) conditions, which allowed detection of 
      ampicillin at concentrations of 2.43 nM. The dependence of ampicillin degradation 
      on alpha-factor concentration and the cultivation time of the yeast was demonstrated, 
      resulting in higher degradation rate with higher alpha-factor concentrations and 
      longer yeast cultivation times. Over 90% of 10 microM ampicillin was degraded within 
      0.5 h using 250 nM alpha-factor and a cultivation period of 24 h. Finally, the 
      transferability to other beta-lactam antibiotics was investigated, resulting in 
      complete degradation of amoxicillin, penicillin G and piperacillin within 24 h.

AB  - The global rise of antimicrobial resistance is a major public health threat, with 
      Escherichia coli facilitating the spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase 
      (ESBL) genes like bla(CTX-M), which confer resistance to third-generation 
      cephalosporins (3GCs). This study examines the impact of 3GC treatment on 
      resistant E. coli clones and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) of ESBL genes in 
      broiler chickens in Quito, Ecuador. Fifteen-day-old Ross broilers were divided 
      into three groups: oral ceftriaxone (100 mg/kg), parenteral ceftriaxone (100 
      mg/kg intramuscular), and control (no treatment). The study included three 
      phases: baseline, antimicrobial administration (5 days), and recovery (15 days). 
      Fecal cultures on McConkey agar, with and without ceftriaxone (2 microg/mL), measured 
      the ratio of 3GC-resistant lactose fermenters. Regardless of the administration 
      route, ceftriaxone significantly increased resistant coliforms (>80%). Five E. 
      coli colonies per animal and time point were analyzed using single-gene typing, 
      with clonal candidates subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Clonal analysis 
      revealed high genetic diversity, averaging three distinct clones per animal. A 
      unique lineage (H34) emerged exclusively during treatment, and new clones 
      appeared post-treatment. The bla(CTX-M-55) variant was the most abundant ESBL 
      gene, persisting despite fluctuations in other bla(CTX-M) variants. Comparative 
      plasmid analysis suggested bla(CTX-M-55) HGT, as plasmids were identified in two 
      genetically distinct E. coli isolates from the same host. Most plasmids belonged 
      to IncFII, with IncX1 and IncN also present. These findings highlight how 3GC 
      treatments rapidly impact ESBL-producing E. coli diversity in the 
      intestine.IMPORTANCEThe global rise of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a 
      critical public health challenge, with Escherichia coli playing a central role in 
      the spread of extended-spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL) genes like bla(CTX-M), 
      which confer resistance to third-generation cephalosporins (3GCs). This study 
      highlights the significant impact of 3GC treatment on the frequency and diversity 
      of 3GC-resistant E. coli clones and horizontal gene transfer of ESBL genes in the 
      intestinal microbiota of broiler chickens. Understanding how antimicrobial 
      treatments drive resistance dynamics in animal populations is crucial for 
      developing strategies to mitigate AMR in both human and veterinary settings.

TI  - Transposon insertion sequencing reveals novel hypermutator genes in Acinetobacter 
      baumannii.
PG  - e0096625
LID - 10.1128/mbio.00966-25 [doi]
AB  - Mutation rates in bacteria are an important determinant of adaptation to new 
      environments and success in different niches. In some bacterial pathogens, 
      ""hypermutator"" variants-most often associated with mutations in components of the 
      DNA mismatch repair system-are associated with increased antibiotic resistance 
      and poorer patient outcomes. We report the serendipitous finding of novel 
      hypermutator genes in Acinetobacter baumannii through genome-scale mutant fitness 
      screening. Exposure of a transposon insertion mutant library of A. baumannii to 
      extended weak antibiotic selection resulted in selection for mutations that 
      directly increased fitness as expected, but also revealed genes where transposon 
      insertion indirectly increased fitness due to elevated general mutation rates. 
      Three novel hypermutator genes were confirmed in A. baumannii: nusB, encoding a 
      transcription antiterminator; ABUW_0208, encoding a hypothetical protein; and 
      ABUW_2121, which encodes a sulfite transporter. We find selection for 
      hypermutator variants in transposon insertion sequencing (TIS) data sets from 
      diverse bacteria under various antibiotic treatments. Our results expand the 
      range of biological functions linked to hypermutator phenotypes in bacteria and 
      provide a workflow for the identification of putative hypermutators by 
      TIS.IMPORTANCEAll organisms have the capacity for evolution through mutation. 
      Bacteria with high mutation rates have a survival advantage in some stressful 
      environments because they generate beneficial mutations more frequently. 
      ""Hypermutators"" are bacterial strains that carry gene inactivations that increase 
      general mutation rates. These variants are important in chronic infections, as 
      their increased genetic diversity allows higher drug resistance and prolonged 
      survival in the host. Only a few different hypermutator genes are known, and 
      there is no high-throughput method for their identification. We have made the 
      serendipitous finding that hypermutator genes can be identified by genome-wide 
      mutant fitness screening under specific selection conditions. We have identified 
      novel hypermutator alleles in the notorious hospital pathogen Acinetobacter 
      baumannii and show that hypermutator variants can be detected in screens of a 
      wide range of pathogens.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Biofilms are organized communities of microorganisms encased in a 
      self-produced matrix that adheres to surfaces and can have both beneficial and 
      detrimental effects in various environments. These biofilms have been linked to 
      severe infections in humans. We investigated the association between antibiotic 
      resistance and biofilm formation in methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus 
      epidermidis (MRSE) isolates. METHODS: A comprehensive search was conducted 
      through data medical data bases using a combination of mesh terms. The data were 
      analyzed using STATA meta-analysis software, and a random effects model was 
      employed to determine the pooled prevalence with a 95% confidence interval (CI). 
      RESULTS: Our findings revealed that the prevalence of MRSA was 61.75% (95% CI: 
      35.6-99.1). The cumulative rate of biofilm formation in MRSE strains was reported 
      to be 83.4% (95% CI: 47.8-99.4). Among the biofilm-related genes, the SdrG gene 
      exhibited the highest frequency (98%), followed by the atlG gene with a frequency 
      of 84%. CONCLUSION: Out of the seven, three documented a positive association. 
      Given the propensity of MRSE strains to form biofilms, it is crucial to implement 
      preventive measures against infections caused by these strains.

PG  - 95826

LID - 95826
AB  - BACKGROUND: The upsurge of antibiotic resistance is a significant challenge to 
      public health, and the dry pipeline of new antibiotics has prompted the discovery 
      of alternative treatment approaches. Enterococcus faecalis (E. faecalis) isolates 
      are often multidrug-resistant, posing challenges to antibiotic therapy. 
      Bacteriophage therapy is being explored as an alternative method to treat the 
      growing population of antibiotic-resistant infections. Nevertheless, many 
      inherent limitations of phages diminish their therapeutic utility, notably the 
      restricted host range and quick development of mutants. The specific types and 
      quantities of bacteriophages and antibiotics may be crucial in generating the 
      optimal phage-antibiotic synergy. AIM: To optimize the doses, order, and timing 
      to optimize the synergy of phages and vancomycin on different bacteria states. 
      METHODS: A volume of 180 muL of E. faecalis bacteria in the logarithmic growth 
      phase, with a concentration of approximately 1 x 10(8) colony forming units 
      (CFUs)/mL, was introduced onto a microtitre plate. Subsequently, 20 muL of phage 
      suspension (1 x 10(6) PFUs/mL), vancomycin (16 microg/mL), or a combination of both 
      was introduced into the designated wells in the specified sequence and incubated 
      at 37  degrees C for 48 hours. The number of live bacteria was counted at different time 
      points using standardized CFU counting protocols. RESULTS: The biofilm model 
      demonstrated that combining phages with vancomycin can eradicate the biofilm. 
      Sequential therapy, involving phage application 8 hours before the antibiotic at 
      a concentration of 10(8) PFUs/mL, proved the most efficient in eliminating the 
      biofilms and killing the planktonic form of E. faecalis. CONCLUSION: The 
      combination of phage ɸEFP01 at a higher concentration with a subinhibitory 
      concentration of vancomycin yields a synergistic antibacterial outcome on E. 
      faecalis strain resistant to vancomycin.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To assess the antibiotic resistance profile, multiple antibiotic 
      resistance index (MARI), and genetic determinants of Pseudomonas spp. isolated 
      from water sources in primary health care centers in Gaza. This investigation 
      aimed to understand potential risks for nosocomial transmission, particularly in 
      the context of deteriorating healthcare and water infrastructure in conflict 
      zone. METHODS: A total of 64 water samples were collected from five primary 
      health care centers across Gaza (April-August 2022). Isolates were identified 
      using standard microbiological techniques. Antibiotic susceptibility was tested 
      via the Kirby-Bauer disk diffusion method; MARI was calculated, and polymerase 
      chain reaction was used to detect New Delhi metallo-beta-lactamase (NDM) genes. 
      RESULTS: Pseudomonas spp. were isolated from 59.4% of samples (desalinated: 
      48.3%; municipal: 68.6%). High resistance was observed to imipenem (84%) and 
      piperacillin (84%), followed by aztreonam (31.6%) and gentamicin (28.9%). The 
      average MARI was 0.4. NDM genes were detected in a subset of isolates. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The presence of multidrug-resistant, NDM-producing Pseudomonas in 
      reverse osmosis and municipal water highlights the urgent need for water safety, 
      screening, and infection control in conflict-affected health care settings.

AB  - This review explores the essential role of pharmacology in dentistry, emphasizing 
      the use of analgesics, antibiotics, and local anesthetics in managing pain, 
      controlling infections, and ensuring procedural comfort. The integration of these 
      pharmacological agents has significantly advanced dental care, allowing for more 
      effective and patient-friendly treatments. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs 
      (NSAIDs) and acetaminophen serve as the primary analgesics, while opioids, 
      despite their efficacy in severe cases, require careful prescribing due to their 
      high risk of dependency and adverse effects. Antibiotics are indispensable for 
      treating odontogenic infections and preventing systemic complications, yet their 
      overuse has contributed to the global challenge of antimicrobial resistance, 
      necessitating stringent antibiotic stewardship in dental practice. Local 
      anesthetics, particularly lidocaine and articaine, have revolutionized pain-free 
      dentistry, with advancements such as liposomal formulations, buffered 
      anesthetics, and computer-assisted anesthesia enhancing their effectiveness and 
      safety. Despite these innovations, challenges such as opioid dependency, 
      antibiotic resistance, and individual variability in anesthetic response 
      underscore the need for personalized pharmacotherapy. Emerging research in 
      pharmacogenomics and novel drug delivery systems holds promise for optimizing 
      treatment outcomes by tailoring pharmacological interventions to individual 
      patient profiles. Future directions should focus on integrating precision 
      medicine, improving antimicrobial strategies, and developing safer, more 
      efficient anesthetic techniques. By incorporating evidence-based prescribing 
      practices and adopting innovative pharmacological approaches, dentistry can 
      continue to evolve toward safer, more effective, and patient-centered care.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Bovine abortions result in significant economic losses to dairy 
      producers, and bacteria are among the most common causes of these abortions. In 
      2021, Streptococcus pluranimalium was isolated from a dairy abortion case for the 
      first time in British Columbia (BC), Canada. This bacterium has previously been 
      recovered from the reproductive tracts of dairy cattle and various other species, 
      including humans. METHODS: Between 2021 and 2023, S. pluranimalium was isolated 
      from the placenta, fetal lung, and/or fetal abomasal contents of 10 aborted dairy 
      fetuses submitted for routine abortion diagnostics. This study was conducted to 
      better characterize the genotype of these 10 isolates. The histopathology of the 
      bovine abortions was examined, and the BC strains were sequenced using Nanopore 
      technology and underwent bioinformatic analysis. RESULTS: The BC strains had an 
      average genome size of 2,313,582 base pairs and an average GC content of 38.59%. 
      Based on whole genome phylogeny, the BC strains were clustered together and 
      distinctly separated from other publicly available strains of this species from 
      different regions and isolation sources. Through Clusters of Orthologous Groups 
      analysis, the BC strains contained a larger proportion of genes associated with 
      the mobilome. Additionally, although we identified only a few antibiotic 
      resistance genes or virulence factors (VFs) in these strains, several of these 
      genes were located within prophage sequences. DISCUSSION: Although the clinical 
      and pathological significance of these bacteria in most abortion cases remains 
      unclear, our findings underscore the importance of continued surveillance and 
      research into uncommon pathogens to better understand their biology and potential 
      impact on human and animal health.

TI  - A Multifunctional MXene@CeO(2)-Enhanced Hydrogel Dressing for Synergistic 
      Photothermal Antibacterial and Antioxidative Therapy in Wound Healing.
PG  - e2500656
LID - 10.1002/adhm.202500656 [doi]
AB  - Chronic wounds infected with drug-resistant bacteria present a formidable 
      clinical challenge, exacerbated by antibiotic overuse that severely compromises 
      healing. Herein, a multifunctional therapeutic hydrogel wound dressing is 
      developed to address these challenges. This advanced nanocomposite hydrogel 
      incorporates cerium dioxide-doped MXene nanosheets (MXene@CeO(2)) within a 
      glycidyl methacrylate-modified gelatin (GMA-Gelatin) matrix and crosslinked into 
      a hydrogel under UV irradiation (GMAG-GEL), forming a near-infrared 
      (NIR)-responsive material (MXene@CeO(2)/GMAG-GEL). This incorporation enhances 
      the mechanical strength of the hydrogel and creates a protective microenvironment 
      for wound repair. In the acidic environment of bacterial infections, 
      MXene@CeO(2)/GMAG-GEL facilitates the electrostatic capture of bacteria. 
      Synergizing with its photothermal capability, it exhibits exceptional 
      antibacterial activity, effectively killing drug-resistant bacteria and 
      disrupting bacterial biofilms. After eradicating the infection, 
      MXene@CeO(2)/GMAG-GEL further alleviates oxidative stress, promotes cell 
      migration and angiogenesis, and induces macrophage polarization toward an 
      anti-inflammatory phenotype. In vivo studies confirmed MXene@CeO(2)/GMAG-GEL 
      significantly accelerates wound closure and tissue regeneration. This work 
      overcomes the key challenges of antibiotic resistance, persistent inflammation, 
      and impaired tissue regeneration, presents a comprehensive therapeutic strategy 
      for drug-resistant bacterial wound infections through a single multifunctional 
      platform.

AB  - The rising prevalence of bacterial antibiotic resistance remains a significant 
      challenge, while many existing antibacterial agents exhibit limited efficacy and 
      notable adverse effects. Edible plants offer a promising avenue for developing 
      novel antimicrobial drugs and preservatives. Etrog citron (Citrus medica L.) and 
      its bioactive phytochemicals have demonstrated activity against various 
      pathogenic microorganisms. However, the potential application of these compounds 
      is hindered by factors such as poor solubility, limited bioavailability, and 
      unclear mechanisms of action. This review consolidates key findings on the 
      antimicrobial properties of extracts and essential oils derived from different 
      parts of Citrus medica, emphasizing strategies for improving the delivery of 
      these bioactive compounds.

TI  - Minocycline Nanocrystals: A New Approach for Treating Acne with Reduced Systemic 
      Side Effects.
LID - 727 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics17060727 [doi]
AB  - Background/Objectives: Acne vulgaris is a chronic skin infection characterized by 
      high sebum secretion, keratosis around hair follicles, inflammation, and 
      imbalance in androgen levels. Acne vulgaris causes permanent scars or skin 
      pigmentation in cases of improper treatment. Oral or topical isotretinoin, 
      contraceptives, and antibiotics are used to treat acne. Minocycline is one of the 
      widely used tetracyclines for this purpose; it inhibits the synthesis of proteins 
      in bacterial ribosomes. Commonly, minocycline is prescribed daily for several 
      months for acne vulgaris. Systemic minocycline is highly distributed into body 
      fluids, and it is associated with several side effects and antibiotic resistance. 
      Additionally, minocycline is highly metabolized in the liver, leading to reduced 
      bioavailability upon systemic delivery. This study aims to develop and 
      characterize minocycline nanocrystals for targeted skin delivery and evaluate 
      their antimicrobial efficacy in treating acne vulgaris. Methods: Minocycline 
      nanocrystals were synthesized using milling or solvent evaporation techniques. 
      Nanocrystals were characterized in terms of particle size, particle distribution 
      index (PDI), zeta potential, and morphology. The antibacterial efficacy against 
      Propionibacterium acne, Staphylococcus aureus, and Staphylococcus epidermidis was 
      evaluated using a minimum inhibitory concentration assay (MIC) and agar well 
      diffusion test in comparison to coarse minocycline. Results: Minocycline 
      nanocrystals had a particle size of 147.4 +/- 7.8 nm and 0.27 +/- 0.017 of PDI. The 
      nanocrystals exhibited a loading efficiency of 86.19 +/- 16.7%. Antimicrobial 
      testing showed no significant difference in activity between minocycline and its 
      nanoparticle formulation. In terms of skin deposition, the nanocrystals were able 
      to deliver minocycline topically to rat skin significantly more than free 
      minocycline. The nanocrystal solution deposited 554.56 +/- 24.13 mug of minocycline 
      into rat skin, whereas free minocycline solution deposited 373.99 +/- 23.32 mug. 
      Conclusions: Minocycline nanocrystals represent a promising strategy for targeted 
      skin delivery in the treatment of acne vulgaris, potentially reducing systemic 
      side effects and antibiotic resistance and improving patient outcomes.

TI  - Dual Nature of Bacteriophages: Friends or Foes in Minimally Processed Food 
      Products-A Comprehensive Review.
LID - 778 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v17060778 [doi]
AB  - The increasing consumer demand for minimally processed foods (MPFs) has 
      highlighted the need for innovative preservation methods that ensure both safety 
      and quality. Among promising biocontrol tools, bacteriophages-viruses that 
      selectively destroy bacteria-have gained significant attention. This review 
      explores the dual role of bacteriophages in the food industry. On one hand, they 
      offer a natural, highly specific, and environmentally friendly means of 
      controlling both pathogenic and spoilage bacteria in MPFs, contributing to 
      improved food safety, extended shelf life, and reduced reliance on antibiotics 
      and chemical preservatives. Their use spans primary production, bio-sanitization, 
      and biopreservation. On the other hand, phages pose significant risks in 
      fermentation-based industries such as dairy, where they can disrupt starter 
      cultures and impair production. This review also examines the regulatory, 
      technological, and safety challenges involved in phage application, including 
      concerns about antibiotic resistance gene transfer, the presence of endotoxins, 
      and scale-up limitations. Ultimately, this paper argues that with proper strain 
      selection and regulation, bacteriophages can become valuable allies in 
      sustainable food systems, despite their potential drawbacks. The application of 
      strictly virulent bacteriophages as part of ""green biotechnology"" could enhance 
      food quality and improve consumer health safety. By implementing the ""farm to 
      fork"" strategy, bacteriophages may contribute to the production of 
      health-promoting and sustainable food.

TI  - Pharmacodynamic Evaluation of Adjuvant Targets: Low Molecular Weight PBP7/8 
      Effects on beta-Lactam Activity Against Carbapenem-Resistant Acinetobacter 
      Baumannii.
LID - 918 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph18060918 [doi]
AB  - Background/Objectives: The increasing occurrence of carbapenem resistance A. 
      baumannii (CRAB) has forced clinicians to seek out alternative options with 
      activity against CRAB. CRAB with inactivated PBP7/8 has been shown to result in 
      an increased outer membrane permeability and could serve as a potential new 
      adjuvant target. Methods: Two isogenic clinical isolates of A. baumannii HUMC1 
      were utilized (WT and HUMC1 DeltaPBP7/8). Static concentration time-kill assays were 
      performed against both isolates with escalating exposures to antibiotics. The 
      resulting data were modeled using the Monolix software suite to capture 
      parameters related to bacterial killing and PBP7/8 synergism. The model results 
      were used to prospectively simulate clinically relevant antibiotic dosing of 
      three antibiotics under physiological conditions and were validated using a 
      hollow-fiber infection model (HFIM). Results: Treatment with monotherapy or 
      combination therapy resulted in concentration-dependent killing for both 
      isolates. Bacterial killing was greater with HUMC1 DeltaPBP7/8 for all tested 
      antibiotic concentrations. The mean bacterial population reduction was 4.38 
      log(10) CFU/mL for HUMC1 and 5.38 log(10) CFU/mL for HUMC1DeltaPBP7/8 knockout 
      isolate. The final mechanism-based model demonstrated improved antibacterial 
      activity with PBP7/8 inhibition through a decline in KC(50) values of 59.7% 
      across the beta-lactams in the PBP7/8 knockout. HFIM observations that were 
      retrospectively compared to the simulated model-predicted bacterial concentration 
      time course showed our final model was able to appropriately capture changes in 
      bacterial population within a dynamic HFIM scenario. Conclusions: The 
      quantification of KC(50) decline and increase in effectiveness of previously 
      sidelined antimicrobial therapies with PBP7/8 inhibition suggests PBP7/8 is a 
      promising potential target for an antibacterial adjuvant. This lends further 
      support to advance to next-stage studies for identifying compounds that 
      specifically inhibit PBP7/8 activity.

TI  - Pharmacokinetic Equations Applied to Obtain New Topological Models in the Search 
      of Antibacterial Compounds.
LID - 865 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph18060865 [doi]
AB  - Background: QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationships) methods have 
      been the basis for the design of new molecules with a certain activity. The great 
      advantage of QSAR methods is that they can predict the pharmacological activity 
      of compounds without the need to obtain or synthesize them previously. Currently, 
      the development of antibiotic resistance by microorganisms is the most important 
      issue in the treatment of infectious diseases. This elevated resistance is 
      associated with expanded morbidity and mortality, as well as an increase in 
      healthcare costs. The development of new molecules with antibacterial activity is 
      therefore urgently needed. Methods: By means of molecular topology, we developed 
      discriminant functions (DF1 and DF2) capable of predicting antibacterial 
      activity. When applied to a database with 6373 chemicals, they selected 266 
      molecules as candidates, from which 41% have this activity, according to the 
      bibliography. Regression equations determining pharmacokinetic properties such as 
      mean residence time (MRT), volume of distribution (V(D)), and clearance (CL) were 
      applied to the selected molecules. Results: We have observed that most 
      antibacterial compounds have pharmacokinetic theoretical values in the intervals 
      20 > MRT > 0, 3 > V(D) > 0, and 500 > CL > 0. We have applied these intervals to 
      our antibacterial model with the objective of finding new antibacterials with a 
      good pharmacokinetic profile. We show that they are an effective tool for 
      discriminating antibacterial compounds, increasing the bibliographic success rate 
      to 50.8, 59, and 61.5%, respectively. When drug-like filters are applied to these 
      new models, the vast majority (89.9-100%) of the selected molecules present 
      antibacterial activity. Conclusions: Considering these results, these new models 
      could avoid the application of drug-likeness filters when searching for new 
      potential antibacterials. All of this proves the usefulness of these 
      mathematical-topological models.

LID - 10.3390/ph18060862 [doi]
AB  - Background/Objectives: The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria presents a major 
      global health challenge, highlighting the need for novel antimicrobial agents 
      such as antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). AMPs are promising due to their 
      broad-spectrum activity, membrane-disruptive mechanisms, and low development of 
      resistance. This study aimed to design and evaluate novel AMPs derived from a 
      synthetic parent peptide (PEP-38). Methods: Novel peptides were designed using 
      bioinformatics tools, including CAMP(R3) and Peptide Ranker. Their antimicrobial 
      potential was validated through in vitro assays, including bacterial 
      susceptibility, antibiofilm activity, cytotoxicity, hemolysis, and time-kill 
      kinetics. Results: Among the designed peptides, Hel-4K-12K showed potent activity 
      against both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with MICs ranging from 
      3.125 to 6.25 microM. It also effectively eradicated biofilms of resistant 
      Staphylococcus aureus at an MBEC of 6.25 microM. Time-kill assays confirmed rapid 
      bactericidal action, achieving complete bacterial elimination within one hour at 
      its MIC. Moreover, Hel-4K-12K exhibited low toxicity toward mammalian MDCK cells 
      (>82% viability at MIC) and minimal hemolytic activity on human erythrocytes. 
      Conclusions: Hel-4K-12K demonstrates strong antibacterial and antibiofilm 
      activities with a favorable safety profile, indicating its potential as a 
      therapeutic candidate for treating infections caused by resistant bacteria. These 
      findings support further development of this peptide as a basis for new 
      antimicrobial drug strategies. In addition to its promising in vitro profile, 
      future studies will investigate Hel-4K-12K in animal models and evaluate 
      strategies for attaining stable formulations, such as peptide encapsulation or 
      PEGylation. These steps are critical to ensure its therapeutic viability in 
      systemic applications.

TI  - Antimicrobial Smart Dressings for Combating Antibiotic Resistance in Wound Care.
LID - 825 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph18060825 [doi]
AB  - Wound healing is a complex, tightly regulated process essential for maintaining 
      skin barrier function. Chronic wounds, often complicated by biofilm-forming 
      bacteria and elevated oxidative stress, pose significant challenges in clinical 
      management. The rise of antibiotic-resistant bacteria has further exacerbated the 
      problem, limiting therapeutic options and complicating wound treatment. 
      Traditional wound care approaches frequently fail to provide real-time accurate 
      insights into wound status, leading to delayed or suboptimal treatments. Recent 
      advancements in modern and smart wound dressings, which integrate various 
      biosensors, different new drug delivery systems, and wireless communication 
      technology, offers promising solutions for monitoring wound progression over 
      time. These innovations enable early detection of adverse events such as 
      bacterial infections and inflammation, facilitating more effective, on-demand 
      treatment. This review highlights the current state of antibiotic-embedded wound 
      dressings, discusses their limitations, and explores the potential of 
      next-generation wound dressings incorporating microelectronic sensors for 
      real-time monitoring and adaptive therapeutic responses to support healing and 
      combat antimicrobial resistance.

TI  - Antibacterial Activity and Molecular Docking of Lignans Isolated from Artemisia 
      cina Against Multidrug-Resistant Bacteria.
LID - 781 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph18060781 [doi]
AB  - The World Health Organization notes that some bacteria have been demonstrated to 
      possess significant public health risks; they have antibiotic resistance, and 
      there are fewer alternatives for control. The n-hexane extract and cinaguaiacin 
      obtained from Artemisia cina show promising antibacterial activity, including 
      against multidrug-resistant bacteria that affect animal and human health. 
      Objective: The aim of this study was to determine the antibacterial activity of 
      the n-hexane extract of A. cina and cinaguaiacin against multidrug-resistant 
      bacteria. Methods:A. cina was collected in the pre-flowering period, the n-hexane 
      extract was obtained, and chromatographic techniques and structure were used to 
      separate the lignans, which were elucidated with nuclear magnetic resonance 
      techniques. Four ATCC strains were used, and four strains were isolated from 
      clinical cases with different resistance profiles. The antibacterial activity was 
      determined by calculating the Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC), Minimum 
      Bactericidal Concentration (MBC), the time-kill kinetics assay, and the cell 
      membrane integrity and DNA release assay. Molecular docking studies of lignans 
      demonstrated the binding mode involved in the active site of DNA gyrase B. 
      Results: The n-hexane extract inhibited growth against 87.5% of the strains 
      tested (MIC 5.31 to 42.5 mg/mL) and showed bactericidal activity against 25% of 
      the strains tested (MBC 0.62 to 85 mg/mL). Cinaguaiacin inhibited growth against 
      100% of the strains tested (MIC, 0.56 to 2.25 mg/mL) and exhibited bactericidal 
      activity against 25% of the strains tested (MBC, 0.62 to 85 mg/mL). Conclusions: 
      The mechanism of cinaguaiacin's action may be associated with damage to the 
      plasma membrane, as the protein and DNA levels were higher than those of the 
      positive control. The n-hexane extract and cinaguaiacin obtained from A. cina 
      showed a bacteriostatic or bactericidal effect, depending on the strain 
      evaluated.

TI  - A Retrospective Study on the Prevalence and Antimicrobial Susceptibility of 
      Gram-Positive Cocci in a Pediatric Department: A Single-Center Report from Egypt.
LID - 10.3390/medicina61061089 [doi]
LID - 1089
AB  - Background and Objectives: The rising prevalence of drug-resistant organisms 
      presents a significant challenge to healthcare, underscoring the importance of 
      implementing effective antimicrobial stewardship programs. The success of these 
      programs depends on access to accurate, evidence-based data reflecting local 
      patterns of antibiotic resistance. This study aims to assess the antimicrobial 
      susceptibility profiles of gram-positive bacteria isolated from pediatric 
      patients in a tertiary care hospital in Egypt. Materials and Methods: We carried 
      out a retrospective study over a five-year period, from January 2018 to December 
      2022, using microbiology laboratory records. Clinical samples included blood, 
      urine, respiratory secretions, pus, wound, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), and pleural 
      fluid. The analysis focused on the resistance patterns of gram-positive pathogens 
      identified through routine culture procedures. Antimicrobial susceptibility 
      testing was performed using the Kirby-Bauer disc diffusion method, and vancomycin 
      MIC was confirmed using the VITEK 2 system. Results: A total of 3223 
      gram-positive bacterial isolates were identified. Staphylococcus aureus, 
      including 82.5% methicillin-resistant strains (MRSA), exhibited high resistance 
      to erythromycin (47.3%) and gentamicin (low potency) (32.1%). Coagulase-negative 
      staphylococci (CoNS) showed the highest erythromycin resistance (up to 88.3%), 
      while Enterococcus spp. demonstrated declining susceptibility to vancomycin, 
      levofloxacin, and erythromycin. Across all isolates, vancomycin and gentamicin 
      (high potency) showed the highest overall susceptibility. Resistance to 
      cotrimoxazole and doxycycline declined over the five-year period. Conclusions: 
      While a decline in resistance was noted for some agents, persistent resistance to 
      key antibiotics (particularly erythromycin and gentamicin) among MRSA and CoNS 
      remains concerning. These findings underscore the importance of targeted 
      antimicrobial stewardship interventions and continuous surveillance to inform 
      empirical therapy in pediatric settings.

LID - 2629
AB  - Background: Anthralin is known for its efficacy in treating psoriasis and acne, 
      possessing poor solubility. Addressing these limitations, the present study 
      endeavors to develop a microemulgel formulation of anthralin aimed at enhancing 
      solubility. Method: The solubility study was performed in various solvents. An 
      o/w (oil-in-water) emulsion was formed using the water titration method, which 
      was optimized by statistical experimental design half-run CCD. The final 
      optimized batch was evaluated for physicochemical and in vitro properties Result: 
      The final optimized batch showed a particle size (PS) of 417 nm, -25.2 mV zeta 
      potential (ZP) and pH 5.8, which remained stable upon centrifugation, 
      heating-cooling and freeze-thawing cycle. Furthermore, microemulsion with 
      Carbopol 943 5% w/v was selected as the gel base for the formation of 
      microemulgel characterized by PS, ZP, pH, and viscosity of 230 nm, -50.6 mV, 6.9 
      and 14,200 cps, respectively, that ensured it a high enough stability. In silico 
      molecular docking between ligand and protein provides the binding energies 
      validating the interaction. Hence, the in silico study was performed for 
      psoriasis and P. acne proteins. An in vitro antibacterial activity study on 
      Propionibacterium revealed a significant efficiency of the formulation and MTT 
      assay using L929 cell line in the presence of the drug-loaded microemulgel 
      indicated an inhibition of growth proving that formulation has anti-psoriatic 
      activity. Conclusions: Combination therapy with Clindamycin might improve 
      efficacy while reducing antibiotic resistance risks.

AB  - The synthesis of a new acyclic and cyclic series of D-Ala-AMP analogues was 
      reported. Chemical modifications were introduced on the carbohydrate, the 
      sulfamate linker, and/or the amino-acid N-terminal moiety in order to increase in 
      vivo stability and cell permeability. These new compounds were evaluated in vitro 
      as DltA inhibitors and also in vivo as adjuvant antibiotics to re-sensitize 
      methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus. Indeed, we showed that seven 
      nucleosides containing either a fluorine atom, an azido group, a 
      difluorophosphonylated allylic ether moiety onto the 2'-position, or a sulfamate 
      and a triazole as the sulfamate linker had moderate to excellent IC(50) values. 
      Among all these new DltA inhibitors, two molecules functionalized by the 
      fluorinated ether or the sulfamide linker were able to efficiently re-sensitize 
      MRSA to imipenem. Quantification of D-alanyl esters confirmed that these two 
      compounds reduced the level of bacterial cell wall D-alanyl residues by 50% and 
      80%.

TI  - Potential Natural Inhibitors of MRSA ABC Transporters and MecA Identified Through 
      In Silico Approaches.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061431 [doi]
LID - 1431
AB  - Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) poses a significant clinical 
      challenge due to its resistance to multiple antibiotics. The urgent need for new 
      therapeutic approaches has led to the exploration of natural compounds as 
      potential treatments, particularly those targeting the key bacterial proteins 
      involved in antibiotic resistance. This study focused on the multidrug ABC 
      transporter and MecA proteins, which play crucial roles in MRSA's pathogenicity 
      and resistance mechanisms. Using computational techniques and molecular docking 
      methods, we assessed the interactions of 80 natural compounds with S. aureus 
      multidrug ABC transporter SAV1866 (SAV1866) and MecA proteins. Our analysis 
      revealed 14 compounds with robust binding to SAV1866 and one compound with a 
      strong affinity for MecA. Notably, these compounds showed weaker affinities for 
      the MgrA, MepR, and arlR proteins, suggesting specificity in their interactions. 
      Among the 15 promising compounds identified, 
      1',2-Binaphthalen-4-one-2',3-dimethyl-1,8'-epoxy-1,4',5,5',8,8'-hexahydroxy-8-O-beta-glucopyranosyl-5'-O-beta-xylopyranosyl(1-->6)-beta-glucopyranoside; 
      Cis-3,4-dihydrohamacanthin b; and Mamegakinone exhibited the highest binding 
      affinities to S. aureus SAV1866. These compounds represent diverse chemical 
      classes, including alkaloids, indole derivatives, naphthalenes, and 
      naphthoquinones, offering a range of structural scaffolds for further drug 
      development. Our findings provide valuable insights into potential new 
      antibacterial agents targeting S. aureus SAV1866 and MecA proteins. These results 
      lay the groundwork for future in vitro and in vivo studies to validate these 
      compounds' efficacy for combating MRSA infections, potentially leading to the 
      development of novel therapeutic strategies against antibiotic-resistant 
      bacteria.

AB  - Given the limited genetic characterization of methicillin-resistant 
      Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in South Korea, we performed whole-genome sequencing 
      (WGS) on eight MRSA strains isolated from raw fish products, including 327 sliced 
      raw flatfish, 111 flatfish stew products, 85 sliced raw rockfish, and 11 rockfish 
      stew products. Phylogenetic analysis revealed two distinct clusters-comprising 
      five ST72-t324-SCCmecIVc strains and two novel sequence types-as well as a 
      singleton strain (ST630-t4549-SCCmecV). A total of five antimicrobial resistance 
      genes (ARGs), four plasmid replicon genes, three mobile genetic element genes, 
      and seventy-three virulence factor genes were identified, with distinct genetic 
      profiles observed between the clusters. Notably, several MRSA strains were 
      isolated from samples obtained at the same retail market, indicating potential 
      local clustering. Four ST72-t324-SCCmecIVc strains, collected from the same 
      market, shared identical profiles in terms of four ARGs, two plasmid replicons, 
      two mobile genetic elements, and several virulence factor genes. These findings 
      provide valuable insights into the genomic characteristics of MRSA in raw fish 
      products and highlight the need for ongoing surveillance and monitoring efforts 
      in South Korea.

AB  - The genome of Geobacillus sp. G4, a thermophilic bacterium isolated from a 
      geothermal field in Peru, was sequenced and analyzed to evaluate its taxonomic 
      and biotechnological potential. This strain exhibits optimal growth at 
      temperatures between 50 and 70  degrees C and at a pH range of 6.0-7.5. Phenotypic assays 
      demonstrated extracellular enzymatic activities, including amylases, cellulases, 
      pectinases, and xylanases, highlighting its potential for efficient 
      polysaccharide degradation. The assembled genome comprises approximately 3.4 Mb 
      with a G+C content of 52.59%, containing 3,490 genes, including coding sequences, 
      rRNAs, and tRNAs. Functional annotation revealed genes associated with key 
      metabolic pathways such as glycogen and trehalose biosynthesis, indicating 
      adaptation to carbohydrate-rich environments. Phylogenetic analyses based on ANI 
      and dDDH values identified Geobacillus thermoleovorans KCTC3570 as its closest 
      relative, suggesting a strong evolutionary relationship. Additionally, the genome 
      harbors gene clusters for secondary metabolites such as betalactone and fengycin, 
      suggesting potential industrial and pharmaceutical applications, including 
      bioremediation. The identification of antibiotic resistance genes, specifically 
      those conferring glycopeptide resistance, underscores their relevance for 
      antimicrobial resistance studies. The presence of enzymes like amylases and 
      pullulanase further emphasizes its biotechnological potential, particularly in 
      starch hydrolysis and biofuel production. Overall, this research highlights the 
      significant potential of Geobacillus species as valuable sources of thermostable 
      enzymes and biosynthetic pathways for industrial applications.

TI  - Virulence and Antibiotic Resistance of Pathogenic Aeromonas caviae from Diseased 
      Macrobrachium rosenbergii.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061343 [doi]
LID - 1343
AB  - In recent years, viral and bacterial diseases have posed serious challenges to 
      the sustainable development of Macrobrachium rosenbergii (giant freshwater prawn) 
      aquaculture, resulting in considerable economic losses across China. Among the 
      bacterial pathogens, Aeromonas caviae has emerged as a notable opportunistic 
      agent capable of causing large-scale mortality in various aquatic species. In 
      this study, a highly virulent strain of A. caviae (designated GMRS4) was isolated 
      from diseased M. rosenbergii exhibiting mass mortality in Yangzhou, Jiangsu 
      Province. The isolate, a Gram-negative bacillus, was identified as the causative 
      agent based on morphological, molecular, and histopathological analyses. 
      Pathogenicity was confirmed through experimental infection, with the strain 
      displaying marked virulence, evidenced by an LD(50) of 1.91 x 10(6) CFU/mL at 96 
      h. Whole-genome sequencing of GMRS4 revealed 4078 coding sequences, including a 
      suite of virulence-associated genes encoding extracellular enzymes (DNase, 
      hemolysin, caseinase, and lecithinase) and toxins (serine protease, elastase, and 
      flagellin). Antimicrobial susceptibility testing indicated resistance to several 
      antibiotics, particularly those in the penicillin and sulfonamide classes, while 
      maintaining sensitivity to quinolones. Genomic analysis further revealed multiple 
      antibiotic resistance genes and virulence genes, offering insights into the 
      pathogenic mechanisms and resistance profile of the strain. This study 
      underscores the threat posed by A. caviae to freshwater prawn aquaculture and 
      provides a genetic basis for developing targeted disease management strategies.

TI  - Shotgun Metagenomic Sequencing Analysis as a Diagnostic Strategy for Patients 
      with Lower Respiratory Tract Infections.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061338 [doi]
LID - 1338
AB  - Conventional diagnostic methods (CDMs) for lower respiratory infections (LRIs) 
      have limitations in detecting causative pathogens. This study evaluates the 
      utility of shotgun metagenomic sequencing (SMS) as a complementary diagnostic 
      tool using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid. Sixteen BAL fluid samples from 
      pneumonia patients with positive CDM results-including bacterial/fungal cultures; 
      PCR for Mycobacterium tuberculosis or cytomegalovirus; and the BioFire((R)) 
      FilmArray((R)) Pneumonia Panel (BioFire Diagnostics LLC, Salt Lake City, UT, 
      USA)-underwent 10 Gb SMS on the Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina, San 
      Diego, CA, USA). Reads were aligned to the NCBI RefSeq database; with fungal 
      identification further supported by internal transcribed spacer (ITS) analysis. 
      Antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) were annotated using the Comprehensive 
      Antibiotic Resistance Database. Microbial reads accounted for 0.00002-0.04971% 
      per sample. SMS detected corresponding bacteria in 63% of cases, increasing to 
      69% when subdominant taxa were included. Fungal reads were low; however, Candida 
      species were identified in four samples via ITS. No viral reads were detected. 
      ARGs meeting perfect match criteria were found in two cases. This is the first 
      real-world study comparing SMS with CDMs, including semiquantitative PCR, in BAL 
      fluid for LRI. SMS shows promise as a supplementary diagnostic method, with 
      further research needed to optimize its performance and cost-effectiveness.

TI  - Genome Sequences of the First Phages Infecting Limnohabitans Reveal Their Global 
      Distribution and Metabolic Potential.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061324 [doi]
LID - 1324
AB  - Bacteriophages (phages) are one of the critical biotic drivers of prokaryotic 
      community dynamics, functions, and evolution. Despite their importance in aquatic 
      ecosystems, very few phages have been isolated from freshwater lakes, hampering 
      our understanding of their ecological importance and usage in a variety of 
      biotechnological applications. Limnohabitans, with a ubiquitous distribution, is 
      a metabolically versatile, fast-growing, morphologically diverse freshwater lake 
      bacterial genera. It is especially abundant in pH-neutral and alkaline aquatic 
      habitats, where it represents an average of 12% of freshwater bacterioplankton 
      and plays an important role in funneling carbon from primary producers to higher 
      trophic levels. However, no phages infecting Limnohabitans have been reported to 
      date. Here, we describe, for the first time, three phages infecting 
      Limnohabitans, DC31, DC33, and YIMV22061, isolated from two freshwater lakes in 
      China and characterized using genome content analysis and comparative genomics. 
      DC31 and DC33, recovered from the eutrophic Dianchi Lake, with auxiliary 
      metabolic genes (AMGs), associated with nucleotide metabolism, whereas YIMV22061, 
      isolated from the oligotrophic Fuxian Lake, carried AMGs involved in antibiotic 
      resistance. The AMGs they carried highlight their impacts on Limnohabitans in 
      different environments. Comparative genomic analyses indicate that DC31, DC33, 
      and YIMV22061 represent three novel species in the Caudoviricetes class. IMG/VR 
      database alignment further reveal that these phages are widely distributed across 
      diverse aquatic and terrestrial ecosystems globally, suggesting their ecological 
      significance. This study provides a basis for better understanding 
      Limnohabitans-phage interactions.

TI  - A Comprehensive Safety Assessment of Ralstonia eutropha H16 for Food 
      Applications: Integrating Genomic, Phenotypic, and Toxicological Analyzes.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061323 [doi]
LID - 1323
AB  - Ralstonia eutropha H16, a metabolically versatile bacterium, has gained 
      prominence as a microbial platform for sustainable bioproduction. While its 
      capabilities in synthesizing single-cell proteins and biodegradable materials are 
      well documented, comprehensive strain-level safety evaluations remain 
      insufficient for food-grade applications. This study systematically assessed the 
      safety of R. eutropha H16 through genomic, phenotypic, and toxicological 
      analyzes. Genomic analyzes revealed the absence or minimal presence of virulence 
      factors and antibiotic resistance genes, aligning with microbiological safety 
      standards. Phenotypic investigations demonstrated a limited gastric fluid 
      tolerance (pH 2.5, survival rate 25.70% after 3 h) and intestinal fluid 
      persistence (pH 8, 44.67% viability after 3 h), coupled with an exceptional bile 
      salt tolerance (0.2% w/v). Antioxidant assays confirmed the fermentation broth 
      specifically scavenges DPPH free radicals (14.60 +/- 1.24 mug Trolox/mL), whereas 
      bacterial suspensions and cell-free supernatants exhibited a strong hydroxyl 
      radical scavenging (>90 U/mL) and superoxide anion inhibition (>100 U/L). Acute 
      toxicity testing indicated no mortality or histopathological abnormalities, with 
      an LD(50) value exceeding 1 x 10(1)(1) CFU/kg. Subacute toxicity studies (28-day, 1 x 
      10(8)-1 x 10(10) CFU/kg) revealed no significant effects on growth, hematology, 
      or organ function. Minor alterations in serum biochemistry might be attributed to 
      physiological adaptation. Subacute exposure induced transient serum ALT 
      fluctuations without hepatorenal dysfunction, while maintaining hematological 
      parameters within physiological ranges. Collectively, these results substantiate 
      the safety of R. eutropha H16 for food-related applications while underscoring 
      the necessity of strain-specific risk assessments for industrial microbial 
      platforms.

TI  - Distribution of Genetic Determinants Associated with CRISPR-Cas Systems and 
      Resistance to Antibiotics in the Genomes of Archaea and Bacteria.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061321 [doi]
LID - 1321
AB  - The CRISPR-Cas system represents an adaptive immune mechanism found across 
      diverse Archaea and Bacteria, allowing them to defend against invading genetic 
      elements such as viruses and plasmids. Despite its broad distribution, the 
      prevalence and complexity of CRISPR-Cas systems differ significantly between 
      these domains. This study aimed to characterize and compare the genomic 
      distribution, structural features, and functional implications of CRISPR-Cas 
      systems and associated antibiotic resistance genes in 30 archaeal and 30 
      bacterial genomes. Through bioinformatic analyses of CRISPR arrays, cas gene 
      architectures, direct repeats (DRs), and thermodynamic properties, we observed 
      that Archaea exhibit a higher number and greater complexity of CRISPR loci, with 
      more diverse cas gene subtypes exclusively of Class 1. Bacteria, in contrast, 
      showed fewer CRISPR loci, comprising a mix of Class 1 and Class 2 systems, with 
      Class 1 representing the majority (~75%) of the detected systems. Notably, 
      Bacteria lacking CRISPR-Cas systems displayed a higher prevalence of antibiotic 
      resistance genes, suggesting a possible inverse correlation between the presence 
      of these immune systems and the acquisition of such genes. Phylogenetic and 
      thermodynamic analyses further highlighted domain-specific adaptations and 
      conservation patterns. These findings support the hypothesis that CRISPR-Cas 
      systems play a dual role: first, as a defense mechanism preventing the 
      integration of foreign genetic material-reflected in the higher complexity and 
      diversity of CRISPR loci in Archaea-and second, as a regulator of horizontal gene 
      transfer, evidenced by the lower frequency of antibiotic resistance genes in 
      organisms with active CRISPR-Cas systems. Together, these results underscore the 
      evolutionary and functional diversification of CRISPR-Cas systems in response to 
      environmental and selective pressures.

TI  - Prediction of Antibiotic Resistance Genes in Cyanobacterial Strains by Whole 
      Genome Sequencing.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061252 [doi]
LID - 1252
AB  - Cyanobacteria are ubiquitous in freshwater environments, but their role in 
      aquatic resistome remains unclear. In this work, we performed whole genome 
      sequencing on 43 cyanobacterial strains isolated from Portuguese 
      fresh/wastewaters. From 43 available non-axenic unicyanoabacterial cultures 
      (containing only one cyanobacterial strain and their co-occurring bacteria), it 
      was possible to recover 41 cyanobacterial genomes from the genomic assemblies 
      using a genome binning software, 26 of which were classified as high-quality 
      based on completeness, contamination, N50 and contig number thresholds. By using 
      the comprehensive antibiotic resistance database (CARD) on the assembled samples, 
      we detected four antibiotic resistance gene (ARG) variants, conferring resistance 
      in pathogenic bacteria to tetracyclines, fluoroquinolones (adeF-type) and 
      macrolides (ermF-type, mefC-type and mphG-type). Among these, adeF-type was the 
      most prevalent gene, found across 11 cyanobacterial genomes from the Nostocales 
      order. Planktothrix presented the highest variety of close ARG matches, with hits 
      for the macrolide resistance genes ermF-type, mefC-type and mphG-type. An 
      analysis of the genomic assemblies also revealed an additional 12 ARGs in 
      bacteria from the phyla Firmicutes, Proteobacteria and Bacteroidetes, present in 
      the cyanobacterial cultures, foreseeing the horizontal gene transfer of ARGs with 
      cyanobacteria. Additionally, more than 200 partial ARGs were detected on each 
      recovered cyanobacterial genome, allowing for future studies of antibiotic 
      resistance genotype/phenotype in cyanobacteria. These findings highlight the 
      importance of further efforts to understand the role of cyanobacteria on the 
      aquatic resistome from a One Health perspective.

TI  - Screening and Validation of Rhizobial Strains for Improved Lentil Growth.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061242 [doi]
LID - 1242
AB  - Lentil is a nutritionally valuable legume crop, rich in protein, carbohydrates, 
      amino acids, and vitamins, and is also used as green manure. Symbiotic nitrogen 
      fixation (SNF) plays a crucial role in lentil growth and development, yet there 
      is limited research on isolating and identifying lentil rhizobia related to 
      nodulation and nitrogen fixation. This study employed tissue block isolation, 
      line purification, and molecular biology to isolate, purify, and identify 
      rhizobial strains from lentils, analyzing their physiological characteristics, 
      including bromothymol blue (BTB) acid and alkali production capacity, antibiotic 
      resistance, salt tolerance, acid and alkali tolerance, growth temperature range, 
      and drought tolerance simulated by PEG6000. Additionally, the nodulation capacity 
      of these rhizobia was assessed through inoculation experiments using the 
      identified candidate strains. The results showed that all isolated rhizobial 
      strains were resistant to Congo red, and nifH gene amplification confirmed their 
      potential as nitrogen fixers. Most strains were positive for H(2)O(2) and BTB 
      acid and base production, with a preference for alkaline environments. In terms 
      of salt tolerance, the strains grew normally at 0.5-2% NaCl, and six strains were 
      identified as salt stress resistant at 4% NaCl. The temperature range for growth 
      was between 4  degrees C and 49  degrees C. Antibiotic assays revealed resistance to ampicillin 
      and low concentrations of streptomycin, while kanamycin significantly inhibited 
      growth. Two drought-tolerant strains, TG25 and TG55, were identified using 
      PEG6000-simulated drought conditions. Inoculation with candidate rhizobial 
      strains significantly increased lentil biomass, highlighting their potential for 
      enhancing crop productivity.

      Perspective on Emerging Zoonotic Threats.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061233 [doi]
LID - 1233
AB  - Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in animals, a multifactorial gastrointestinal 
      disorder marked by chronic inflammation, has increasingly been linked to 
      Clostridioides difficile infections. Recognized for its pathogenic role in human 
      pseudomembranous colitis, C. difficile is now emerging as a critical agent in 
      veterinary medicine, particularly in livestock (e.g., cattle, pigs), companion 
      animals (dogs, cats), and wildlife. Over the past five years, evidence has 
      highlighted its association with IBD-like syndromes in animals, driven by 
      toxin-mediated mechanisms (TcdA/TcdB), antibiotic-induced dysbiosis, and 
      environmental spore transmission. This opinion article synthesizes recent 
      findings on C. difficile's zoonotic potential, diagnostic ambiguities (e.g., 
      distinguishing colonization from active infection), and therapeutic challenges, 
      including antibiotic resistance. We emphasize the urgent need for integrated One 
      Health strategies to mitigate risks to animal and human health, advocating for 
      improved surveillance, novel therapies, and interdisciplinary research.

TI  - Population Genomics, Virulence Traits, and Antimicrobial Resistance of 
      Streptococcus suis Isolated in China.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061197 [doi]
LID - 1197
AB  - Streptococcus suis is a significant zoonotic pathogen of public health 
      importance. In this study, whole-genome sequencing of 177 isolates of 
      Streptococcus suis, isolated from diseased swine across 15 provinces in China 
      between 2017 and 2019, was performed. A total of 23 serotypes and 28 ST types 
      were identified, with serotypes 2 and 3 comprising 50.8% of the isolates, and 
      sequence types ST353 and ST117 accounting for 23.7%. Clustering analysis based on 
      known virulence-associated factors (VAFs) resulted in the identification of four 
      distinct clusters, and virulence was assessed using animal models, including a 
      unique, highly virulent cluster designated as cluster I. Drug susceptibility 
      testing indicated that 97.7% of the isolates were multidrug-resistant. A total of 
      26 resistance-associated genes were identified within the genome, 18 of which 
      were associated with integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) and/or 
      integrative mobilizable elements (IMEs). Nevertheless, our understanding of suis 
      virulence in terms of phylogeny remains incomplete. This study contributes to the 
      understanding of the population structure and genetic characteristics of suis, 
      provides a framework and novel partitioning approach for future investigations 
      into its virulence and pathogenicity, and complements the data on antibiotic 
      resistance.

TI  - Genomic Diversity of the tet(X)-Positive Myroides Species.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061180 [doi]
LID - 1180
AB  - The rapid spread of tet(X) genes capable of inactivating tigecycline represents a 
      critical challenge to global public health. This study aims to explore the 
      distribution, genetic diversity, and transferability of tet(X) genes in Myroides, 
      a genus of Gram-negative bacteria increasingly implicated in multidrug-resistant 
      (MDR) bacterial infections. From 2021 to 2024, 646 samples of chicken, sheep, 
      soil, and water were randomly collected, yielding nine chicken-derived 
      tet(X)-positive Myroides sp. strains in Shandong, China. All of them were MDR to 
      tetracycline, ceftazidime, gentamicin, amikacin, colistin, ciprofloxacin, 
      gatifloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, with elevated minimum inhibitory 
      concentrations (MICs) for tigecycline, florfenicol, and macrolides, but exhibited 
      susceptibility to meropenem (100%), ampicillin-sulbactam (66.7%), and cefotaxime 
      (33.3%). A genomic analysis of the isolates and 86 public tet(X)-positive 
      Myroides genomes revealed the widespread distribution of tet(X) and 
      macrolide-inactivating estT genes across 12 Myroides species, including 7 novel 
      species. Eight tet(X) and eight estT variants were identified, half of which were 
      novel. The phylogenetic analysis highlighted interspecies transmission risks, 
      with ISCR2-mediated transposons of tet(X6) and estT-2 across Myroides, 
      Riemerella, Empedobacter, Providencia, Acinetobacter, and Proteus species. These 
      findings illuminate the genomic diversity driving antibiotic resistance in 
      understudied bacterial taxa, with implications for global One Health strategies.

AB  - Livestock are a source of zoonotic pathogens and bacteria harbouring 
      antimicrobial resistance (AMR) that can pose a threat to public health. This 
      study assessed the burden of antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and genomic diversity 
      of Salmonella and Escherichia coli at 25 poultry farms in Oyo State, Nigeria. The 
      farm-level occurrence of Salmonella was 48%, with 12 serovars identified, 
      including S. Kentucky Sequence Type 198. Notably, 70% of Salmonella isolates were 
      resistant to fluoroquinolones, and multidrug resistance was observed in S. 
      Kentucky and S. Derby. The study also found a 52% farm-level occurrence of 
      extended-spectrum beta-lactamase-producing E. coli, with four bla(CTX-M) variants 
      detected (bla(CTX-M-15), bla(CTX-M-27), bla(CTX-M-55), and bla(CTX-M-65)). A 
      genomic analysis revealed the dissemination of bacterial clones between farms, 
      indicating potential routes of transmission. The high occurrence of AMR in both 
      Salmonella and E. coli presents a potential public health risk, mainly through 
      the consumption of contaminated poultry products. The study highlights the need 
      for improved farm biosecurity and appropriate antimicrobial use to reduce the 
      spread of resistant strains and combat AMR. These findings contribute to the 
      Nigerian National Action Plan for AMR and underscore the importance of ongoing 
      research and interventions in the poultry sector.

TI  - Surgical site infections: a comprehensive review.
LID - 10.20408/jti.2025.0019 [doi]
AB  - Surgical site infections (SSIs) represent a major public health challenge, 
      contributing to increased morbidity, mortality, and healthcare costs worldwide. 
      This paper presents a comprehensive review of the epidemiology, classification, 
      risk factors, microbiological aspects, treatment modalities, and prevention 
      strategies for SSIs, based on contemporary research and evidence-based practice 
      protocols. An extensive literature review was conducted, synthesizing existing 
      studies on SSIs. A comprehensive search was performed in PubMed, Embase, Cochrane 
      Library, and guidelines from leading organizations such as the American College 
      of Surgeons, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, the World Health 
      Organization, and the Infectious Diseases Society of America. Inclusion criteria 
      encompassed peer-reviewed articles as well as American and European medical 
      guidelines focusing on the epidemiology, risk factors, microbiology, treatment, 
      and prevention of SSIs. The review adhered to the PECO (population, exposure, 
      comparator, outcome) framework. Some of the most significant global concerns 
      related to SSIs include antibiotic resistance and the contamination of surgical 
      instruments, particularly in resource-poor settings. Trauma patients, especially 
      those undergoing emergency procedures or sustaining open fractures, are at 
      increased risk for SSIs due to the severity of their injuries and higher 
      contamination risks. These findings underscore the importance of preventive 
      measures, such as appropriate preoperative interventions, strict aseptic 
      techniques, and proper antibiotic prophylaxis, in reducing SSI incidence and 
      improving patient outcomes.

      quasipneumoniae ATCC 700603 in response to meropenem stress.
PG  - 369
LID - 10.1186/s12866-025-04100-6 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Klebsiella is one of the most challenging superbugs having a high 
      tendency to acquire rapid resistance to many antibiotics, even the ones 
      recognized as the last resort. In several hospitals and environmental niches, 
      Klebsiella is continuously exposed to residual amounts of antibiotics at 
      sub-inhibitory concentrations forming an environmental stress motivating them to 
      adapt and evolve antimicrobial resistance. In the present study, meropenem (MEM) 
      resistance was induced experimentally in a MEM-sensitive strain of K. 
      quasipneumoniae ATCC 700603 through sequential sub-culturing in presence of 
      sub-inhibitory concentrations of MEM over a period of 20 days. To uncover the 
      possible mechanisms standing behind the evolution of antimicrobial resistance 
      upon successive exposure to stress of MEM rather than horizontal gene transfer 
      (HGT) of antibiotic resistance genes. RESULTS: Fully adapted cells of the 20th 
      generation (G20) showed MEM-resistance with elevated minimum inhibitory 
      concentration (MIC) by 256-fold compared to the parent cells (G0). The main 
      mechanism of resistance was the production of carbapenemases, which was assured 
      by different tests including nitrocefin, modified-Hodge test (MHT), and modified 
      carbapenem inactivation method (mCIM). The degradation of MEM reached 65.93% by 
      the produced carbapenemases of G20 as determined by the HPLC analysis. 
      Transcriptomics analysis of the class D carbapenemase encoding gene, bla(OXA-2), 
      revealed that it was significantly over-expressed by a 3.12-fold (p < 0.05) in 
      G20 compared to G0. CONCLUSION: The evolved MEM resistance aroused mainly from 
      MEM degradation by carbapenemases, neither increased efflux nor decreased influx 
      of MEM. The rational use of antibiotics is essential to reduce bacterial exposure 
      to the environmental basal levels of antibiotics and decreasing the evolution of 
      antimicrobial resistance.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study investigates the clinical, microbiological, and prognostic 
      variations between hypermucoviscous Klebsiella pneumoniae (hmKp) and 
      non-hypermucoviscous Kp (n-hmKp) infections. METHODS: A total of 381 cases of 
      community-acquired Klebsiella pneumoniae (cKp) infections at Zhongshan People's 
      Hospital between January 2019 and November 2024 were analyzed. Infection 
      characteristics, mortality risk factors, and antimicrobial susceptibility 
      profiles were compared between hmKp and n-hmKp groups. RESULTS: No significant 
      differences were observed between patients infected with n-hmKp and hmKp in terms 
      of median age, gender, underlying conditions, hospital stay, ICU stay, and 
      hospital mortality rates (all P > 0.05). However, the SOFA score was higher, and 
      shock occurred more frequently in hmKp infections (all P < 0.05). In addition, 
      hmKp exhibits a higher propensity for inducing invasive infections (P = 0.000). 
      Multivariable logistic regression identified higher median age (OR: 1.08, 
      P = 0.005), and tumors (OR: 5.73, P = 0.035) as risk factors for mortality in 
      n-hmKp infections. Conversely, higher SOFA scores (OR: 2.08, P = 0.000), shock 
      (OR: 48.55, P = 0.001), and elevated levels of procalcitonin (OR: 0.96, 
      P = 0.019), lactic acid (OR: 1.78, P = 0.015), and troponin T (OR: 1.01, 
      P = 0.029) were associated with mortality in hmKp infections. Both hmKp and 
      n-hmKp strains exhibited varying degrees of antibiotic resistance, with n-hmKp 
      strains demonstrating higher resistance to common antibiotics, especially for 
      ceftriaxone, imipenem, and piperacillin-tazobactam compared to hmKp strains (all 
      P < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: N-hmKp and hmKp exhibit significant differences in both 
      clinical and microbiological characteristics. Heightened awareness of them is 
      essential for effective management.

TI  - Evaluating the Breadth and Reliability of Influenza Vaccine Protection 
      Indicators: a Secondary Analysis of an Animal Challenge Trial.
LID - jiaf331 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/infdis/jiaf331 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers are key correlates of 
      influenza vaccine protection, yet a systematic comparison of HAI-based 
      immunogenicity indicators is lacking for guiding vaccine development. This study 
      aimed to compare these indicators by evaluating their correlation with influenza 
      disease outcomes. METHOD: We performed a secondary analysis of a mouse challenge 
      study, in which 14 groups of mice were first challenged and received different 
      H3N2 vaccines, and were subsequently infected with H3N2 (A/Kansas/14/2017). 
      Disease outcomes were measured by weight loss and lung viral load. HAI titers 
      were assessed against nine H3N2 strains, including the infecting strain, vaccine 
      strains, and others, generating 11 HAI-based indicators considering the HAI titer 
      was against the vaccine strains, the infecting strain, and the similarity between 
      strains based on two antigenic distance algorithms. Correlations with disease 
      outcomes were evaluated using linear regression models, with R-squared values and 
      bootstrap resampling estimating variance. RESULTS: HAI titers against vaccine 
      strains showed the weakest correlation with disease outcomes due to strain 
      mismatch. The proportion of seroprotection among the nine strains demonstrated 
      the strongest correlation, with R-squared values of  approximately 0.4 (weight loss) and  approximately 0.6 
      (lung viral load). Indicators based on antigenic distance were also predictive 
      but not superior. CONCLUSIONS: Relying solely on HAI titers against a single 
      virus is insufficient for assessing influenza vaccine effectiveness. Calculating 
      the proportion of seroprotection, a computationally efficient metric, offers 
      robust predictive power and may be superior to traditional single strain titer 
      even when it matches the infecting strain.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has underscored the significant challenges of vaccine 
      distribution, particularly to low- and middle-income countries. Even when 
      vaccines are made available through purchases or donations, issues such as 
      insufficient trained medical personnel and inadequate infrastructure impede their 
      widespread use. To address these challenges, we propose the Microneedle & 
      Film-Forming Gel Transdermal Delivery Strategy (MFT strategy), which combines the 
      minimally invasive nature of microneedles with the stability of film-forming gels 
      that can be stored at room temperature. This strategy aimed to simplify vaccine 
      production, reduce logistical burdens, and improve the efficiency of transdermal 
      vaccine delivery while generating strong immune responses. In this study, we used 
      ovalbumin as a model antigen and developed microneedles from methacrylic 
      acid-modified hyaluronic acid, polyvinylpyrrolidone, and polyvinyl alcohol, in 
      conjunction with a polyvinyl alcohol-borax (PVA-B) film-forming gel. In vitro 
      experiments demonstrated that the MFT strategy has achieved an efficiency 
      improvement of 202.75 % compared to previously reported strategies. Besides, 
      PVA-B film forming gel displayed strong antimicrobial properties and effectively 
      stabilized proteins over 30 days at 25  degrees C, preserving the antigenic structure 
      essential for vaccine efficacy. In vivo tests revealed that the MFT strategy 
      induced humoral immune responses comparable to those achieved by intramuscular 
      injection, with histological analysis confirming good skin tolerance and safety. 
      Overall, the MFT strategy represents a promising vaccine delivery method with 
      substantial clinical potential.

AB  - The messenger RNA (mRNA) platform technology is advancing the deployment of 
      vaccines and therapeutics to combat various diseases. The COVID-19 pandemic 
      highlighted the urgent need for large-scale mRNA vaccine production, exposing 
      supply constraints and driving demand for more cost-effective and scalable 
      manufacturing solutions. To address these challenges, integrated and continuous 
      mRNA manufacturing processes provide significant advantages over traditional 
      batch methods, including increased efficiency, reduced labor requirements, a 
      smaller manufacturing footprint, and faster production. Here, we present the 
      first continuous process integrating: 1) continuous flow encapsulation of mRNA 
      into lipid nanoparticles (LNPs), 2) real-time in-line particle size and 
      polydispersity index (PDI) monitoring using spatially-resolved dynamic light 
      scattering, 3) single-pass tangential flow filtration (SP-TFF) purification of 
      mRNA-LNPs. The continuously produced and SP-TFF purified mRNA-LNP critical 
      quality attributes are: 95.5+/-4 % encapsulation efficiency, 105+/-6 nm average 
      particle size, 0.1+/-0.02 PDI, 0.003 % residual ethanol content, 0.4+/-0.05% fraction 
      of unloaded LNPs, 86.2+/-3 % mRNA integrity, and the final pH of 7. During the TFF 
      purification, an increase in average mRNA-LNP size and formation of bleb 
      compartments on the particle's surface was also observed. Additionally, a 90% 
      recovery of mRNA-LNPs was achieved using regenerated cellulose (RC) membrane 
      SP-TFF with an overall concentration factor of 10X. This study lays the 
      foundations for faster and more efficient manufacturing of high-quality mRNA 
      vaccines and therapeutics.

TI  - Ferritin and Encapsulin Nanoparticles Enhance Immunogenicity of p30 Protein for 
      ASFV Vaccine Development.
LID - 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.5c00050 [doi]
AB  - African swine fever (ASF) represents a significant threat to the global swine 
      industry due to the absence of a commercially available vaccine. The rational 
      design of vaccine antigens is crucial for improving vaccine efficacy and guiding 
      its development. The p30 protein of the African swine fever virus (ASFV) is an 
      early membrane protein involved in the viral invasion of host cells. Antibodies 
      against p30 effectively block viral internalization, highlighting its potential 
      as a key vaccine antigen. In this study, ferritin and encapsulin nanoparticle 
      platforms were utilized to display the p30 protein on their surfaces. The F/E-p30 
      nanoparticles significantly enhanced both the antigenicity and immunogenicity of 
      the p30 protein. In vivo experiments revealed that the p30 protein, conjugated 
      onto nanoparticles, accumulated in follicular dendritic cells (FDCs) within lymph 
      nodes. This accumulation resulted in an increased number of T follicular helper 
      (Tfh) and germinal center B (GCB) cells, thereby promoting the activation and 
      maturation of both B and T cells. Compared to the p30 monomer, the p30 
      nanoparticles elicited stronger immune responses and facilitated the production 
      of more potent, broad-spectrum antibodies that more effectively inhibit the 
      internalization of genotype II and I/II recombinant ASFV strains. The 
      p30-conjugated nanoparticles developed in this study present a competitive 
      advantage as nanoparticle antigens, providing a robust foundation for ASFV 
      vaccine development.

TI  - Bias in control selection associated with the use of rapid tests in influenza 
      vaccine effectiveness studies.
LID - dyaf089 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ije/dyaf089 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: In test-negative design (TND) studies that use rapid tests to 
      estimate influenza vaccine effectiveness (VE), a common concern is case-control 
      misclassification due to imperfect diagnostic accuracy. An imperfect test can 
      also fail to exclude from the control group people infected with other influenza 
      types or other vaccine-preventable respiratory viruses. We investigated these 
      biases while evaluating VE for the 2023/24 seasonal influenza vaccination. 
      METHODS: A TND study was conducted among outpatients aged >/=6 months of age who 
      visited an outpatient clinic in Hong Kong between 15 December 2023 and 13 August 
      2024. VE was estimated for polymerase chain reaction (PCR)- and 
      rapid-test-confirmed influenza A and B with exclusions of other types of 
      influenza and SARS-CoV-2 based on either PCR or rapid test. Alternatively, for 
      the exclusion of SARS-CoV-2, we adjusted the analysis with COVID-19 vaccination. 
      VE was estimated by using logistic regression adjusted for confounders. RESULTS: 
      In a study population of 1691 participants, VE against influenza A by PCR was 49% 
      [95% confidence interval (CI) 26%-65%] after the exclusion of PCR-confirmed 
      influenza B and SARS-CoV-2 controls. The corresponding VE against influenza B was 
      65% (95% CI 35%-81%). VE estimated by adjusting for COVID-19 vaccination status 
      yielded similar estimates to these. When case-control status and exclusions from 
      test-negative controls were determined by using the rapid test, VE was reduced by 
      5%age-15%age points. CONCLUSION: In TND studies using rapid tests, reduced 
      sensitivity affects both case-control classification and control group 
      exclusions, potentially causing bias. New methods for these biases could help to 
      adapt participatory cohorts for the monitoring of VE for influenza, COVID-19, and 
      respiratory syncytial virus.

TI  - Implications of Anaphylaxis Following mRNA-LNP Vaccines: It Is Urgent to 
      Eliminate PEG and Find Alternatives.
LID - 798 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics17060798 [doi]
AB  - The mRNA vaccine has protected humans from the Coronavirus disease 2019 
      (COVID-19) and has taken the lead in reversing the epidemic efficiently. However, 
      the Centre of Disease Control (CDC) reported and raised the alarm of allergic or 
      acute inflammatory adverse reactions after vaccination with mRNA-LNP vaccines. 
      Meanwhile, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has added four black-box 
      warnings in the instructions for mRNA-LNP vaccines. Numerous studies have proven 
      that the observance of side effects after vaccination is indeed positively 
      correlated to the level of anti-PEG antibodies (IgM or IgG), which are enhanced 
      by PEGylated preparations like LNP vaccine and environmental exposure. After 
      literature research and review in the past two decades, it was found that the 
      many clinical trial failures (BIND-014, RB006 fell in phase II) of PEG modified 
      delivery system or PEGylated drug were related to the high expression of anti-PEG 
      IgM and IgG. In the background of shooting multiple mRNA-LNP vaccines in billions 
      of people around the world in the past three years, the level of anti-PEG 
      antibodies in the population may have significantly increased, which brings 
      potential risks for PEG-modified drug development and clinical safety. This 
      review summarizes the experience of using mRNA-LNP vaccines from the mechanism of 
      the anti-PEG antibodies generation, detection methods, clinical failure cases of 
      PEG-containing products, harm analysis of abuse of PEGylation, and alternatives. 
      In light of the increasing prevalence of anti-PEG antibodies in the population 
      and the need to avoid secondary injuries, this review article holds greater 
      significance by offering insights for drug developers. It suggests avoiding the 
      use of PEG excipients when designing PEGylated drugs or PEG-modified 
      nano-formulations and provides references for strategies such as utilizing 
      PEG-free or alternative excipients.

TI  - Melanoma Vaccines: Comparing Novel Adjuvant Treatments in High-Risk Patients.
LID - 656 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060656 [doi]
AB  - Background: The emergence of checkpoint inhibitors (CPIs) has significantly 
      improved survival outcomes in later-stage melanoma. However, the efficacy of 
      these treatments remains limited, with around 50% of later-stage melanoma 
      patients experiencing recurrence. As variable response rates to CPIs persist, the 
      development of cancer vaccines has emerged as a potential strategy to augment 
      antitumor immune responses. Results: This review compares two promising 
      personalized therapeutic cancer vaccine trials in advanced melanoma: Elios 
      Therapeutics' Tumor Lysate (TL) vaccine and Moderna's mRNA-4157 vaccine. The TL 
      vaccine, which utilizes yeast cell wall particles (YCWPs) loaded with autologous 
      tumor lysate, and the mRNA-4157 vaccine, which encodes up to 34 patient-specific 
      neoantigens, both aim to stimulate robust tumor-specific immune responses. Both 
      trials were phase 2b randomized studies, with Elios Therapeutics' trial employing 
      a double-blind, placebo-controlled design, while Moderna's was open-label. Both 
      trials had roughly equivalent sample sizes (n = 187 and n = 157, respectively) 
      with similar demographics and disease characteristics. The TL trial reported 
      improvements in disease-free survival (DFS) with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.52 (p < 
      0.01) over 36 months, whereas the mRNA-4157 trial demonstrated improvements in 
      recurrence-free survival (RFS) with an HR of 0.56 (p = 0.053) over 18 months. The 
      TL vaccine exhibited lower rates of related grade 3 adverse events (<1%) compared 
      to the mRNA vaccine (12%). Key differences between the two trials include the use 
      of CPIs, with 100% of patients in the mRNA trial receiving pembrolizumab versus 
      37% of the patients in the TL trial receiving either an anti-PD-1 or anti-CTLA-4. 
      The production processes also varied significantly, with the mRNA vaccine 
      requiring individualized sequencing and a 9-week production time, while the TL 
      vaccine utilized tumor lysate with a 1-3-day production time. Conclusions: While 
      both vaccines demonstrated promising efficacy, future phase 3 trials are needed 
      to further evaluate their potential as adjuvant therapies for melanoma. This 
      review highlights the comparative strengths and limitations of these vaccine 
      platforms, providing insight into the evolving landscape of adjuvant cancer 
      vaccines.

TI  - Innovation in mRNA Vaccines and RNAi via Protein Nanocages.
LID - 653 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060653 [doi]
AB  - Self-assembling protein nanocages (SAPNs) are distinct natural structures formed 
      by the self-assembly of identical subunits, providing a highly efficient platform 
      and a novel strategy for vaccine development and RNAi therapy. Their internal 
      cavity allows for precise cargo encapsulation, while the externally modifiable 
      surface supports multivalent antigen presentation, thereby enhancing stability, 
      targeted delivery, and immune activation. In addition to serving as stable 
      subunit vaccines with multivalent antigen display, SAPNs can be incorporated into 
      mRNA vaccines (SAPN-RNA vaccines) by pre-fusing with the antigen. This strategy 
      stabilizes secreted antigenic proteins with prolonged presentation to the immune 
      system, and improves vaccine efficacy while reducing off-target effects and 
      minimizing required doses. Additionally, SAPNs can overcome cellular uptake 
      barriers, enhance DNA vaccine efficacy, and enable the co-delivery of antigens 
      and adjuvants. Functionalization with adjuvants or targeting ligands further 
      improves their immunostimulatory properties and specificity. The SAPN-RNAi 
      strategy optimizes siRNA delivery by promoting lysosomal escape, enhancing 
      targeted uptake, and protecting siRNA from degradation through SAPN 
      encapsulation. This review examines the structural and functional properties of 
      protein nanocages and their applications in vaccine design and RNAi delivery, 
      emphasizing their synergistic effects, and exploring current progress, 
      challenges, and future directions. In conclusion, SAPNs represent a versatile 
      multifunctional platform with broad applicability across subunit, mRNA and DNA 
      vaccines, adjuvant co-delivery, and RNAi therapeutics, with significant potential 
      against viral infections.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) Protein-Protein Conjugate Induces 
      Similar or Better Antibody Responses as Spike mRNA in Rhesus Macaques.
LID - 648 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060648 [doi]
AB  - Background/Objectives: Rapid development of vaccines against SARS-CoV-2 was 
      pivotal to controlling the COVID-19 pandemic. The emergency also provided a rare 
      opportunity to test novel vaccine platforms such as mRNA in large clinical 
      trials. Most of the early vaccines used SARS-CoV-2 Spike protein as the target 
      antigen. Nevertheless, subsequent studies have shown that Receptor Binding Domain 
      (RBD) of Spike also can yield efficacious vaccines, and we previously 
      demonstrated that chemical conjugation of RBD to a carrier protein, EcoCRM((R)), 
      enhanced antibody responses and induced strong virus neutralization activity in 
      mice. Methods: Here, we compared the immunogenicity of this conjugate to that of 
      an approved mRNA vaccine from Pfizer/BioNTech in rhesus macaques over a period of 
      nine months. Results: AS01-adjuvanted RBD conjugate induced a similar or better 
      antibody response, receptor binding inhibition, and virus neutralization activity 
      against different variants of SARS-CoV-2, compared to mRNA. IgG subclass profiles 
      induced by conjugate and mRNA vaccines were initially dominated by IgG1 and IgG3 
      then switched to IgG2 and IgG4 dominant profiles during the subsequent six-month 
      period. Polyclonal immune sera from the conjugate and mRNA had similar antibody 
      avidity at multiple time points. Conclusions: In summary, antibody responses in 
      rhesus macaques induced by the RBD-EcoCRM conjugate and the Spike mRNA vaccine 
      are very similar. These results demonstrate the potential for the RBD-EcoCRM 
      conjugate as a vaccine against SARS-CoV-2.

      Protection.

LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060635 [doi]
AB  - The continuous evolution of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2) and the emergence of variants of concern (VOCs) underscore the 
      critical role of vaccination in pandemic control. These mutations not only 
      enhance viral infectivity but also facilitate immune evasion and diminish vaccine 
      efficacy, necessitating ongoing surveillance and vaccine adaptation. Current 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, including inactivated, live-attenuated, viral vector, 
      protein subunit, virus-like particle, and nucleic acid vaccines, face challenges 
      due to the immune evasion strategies of emerging variants. Moreover, other 
      sarbecoviruses, such as SARS-CoV-1 and SARS-related coronaviruses (SARSr-CoVs) 
      pose a potential risk for future outbreaks. Thus, developing vaccines capable of 
      countering emerging SARS-CoV-2 variants and providing broad protection against 
      multiple sarbecoviruses is imperative. Several innovative vaccine platforms are 
      being investigated to elicit broad-spectrum neutralizing antibody responses, 
      offering protection against both current SARS-CoV-2 variants and other 
      sarbecoviruses. This review presents an updated overview of the key target 
      antigens and therapeutic strategies employed in current SARS-CoV-2 vaccines. 
      Additionally, we summarize ongoing approaches for the development of vaccines 
      targeting infectious sarbecoviruses.

AB  - Background/Objectives:Cancer vaccine targets mostly include mutations and 
      overexpressed proteins. However, cancer-associated post-translational 
      modifications (PTMs) may also induce immune responses. Previously, our group 
      established the enzyme protein arginine deiminase type-2 (PADI2), which catalyzes 
      citrullination modification, is highly expressed in triple-negative breast cancer 
      (TNBC), promoting antigenicity. Methods: Here, we show the workflow of designing 
      citrullinated enolase 1 (citENO1) vaccine peptides identified from breast cancer 
      cells by mass spectrometry and demonstrate TNBC vaccine efficacy in the mouse 
      model. Immunized mice with citENO1 peptides or the corresponding unmodified 
      peptides, plus Poly I:C as an adjuvant, were orthotopically implanted with a TNBC 
      murine cell line. Results: Vaccination with citENO1, but not unmodified ENO1 
      (umENO1), induced a greater percentage of activated CD8+ PD-1+ T cells and 
      effector memory T cells in skin-draining lymph nodes (SDLNs). Remarkably, the 
      citENO1 vaccine delayed tumor growth and prolonged overall survival, which was 
      further enhanced by PD-1 blockade. Conclusions: Our data suggest that 
      cancer-restricted post-translational modifications provide a source of vaccines 
      that induce an anti-cancer immune response.

TI  - Development of an Influenza/COVID-19 Combination mRNA Vaccine Containing a Novel 
      Multivalent Antigen Design That Enhances Immunogenicity of Influenza Virus B 
      Hemagglutinins.
LID - 628 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060628 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Developing next-generation mRNA-based seasonal influenza 
      vaccines remains challenging, primarily because of the relatively low 
      immunogenicity of influenza B hemagglutinin (HA) antigens. We describe a 
      systematic vaccine development strategy that combined vector and antigen design 
      optimization. METHODS: Novel untranslated region (UTR) sequences and a hybrid 
      poly(A) tail were used to increase plasmid stability and mRNA expression. Fusion 
      proteins containing HA antigens linked by T4 foldon domains were engineered to 
      enhance the immune responses against influenza B HA antigens and to permit the 
      expression of multiple HA ectodomains from a single mRNA species. The vaccine 
      performance was verified in a traditional encapsulated lipid nanoparticle (LNP) 
      formulation that requires long-term storage at temperatures below -15  degrees C as well 
      as in a proprietary thermo-stable LNP formulation developed for the long-term 
      storage of the mRNA vaccine at 2-8  degrees C. RESULTS: In preclinical studies, our 
      next-generation seasonal influenza vaccine tested alone or as a combination 
      influenza/COVID-19 mRNA vaccine elicited hemagglutination inhibition (HAI) titers 
      significantly higher than Fluzone HD, a commercial inactivated influenza vaccine, 
      across all 2024/2025 seasonal influenza strains, including the B/Victoria lineage 
      strain. At the same time, the combination mRNA vaccine demonstrated superior 
      neutralizing antibody titers to 2023/2024 Spikevax, a commercial COVID-19 
      comparator mRNA vaccine. CONCLUSIONS: Our data demonstrate that the 
      multimerization of antigens expressed as complex fusion proteins is a powerful 
      antigen design approach that may be broadly applied toward mRNA vaccine 
      development.

TI  - Predicting the Epidemiological Effects in the United Kingdom of Moving from PCV13 
      to PCV15 in the Routine Pediatric 1 + 1 Vaccination Schedule.
LID - 627 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060627 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Pneumococcal conjugate vaccines (PCVs) were first 
      introduced in the pediatric UK National Immunization Programme (NIP) in 2006 and 
      subsequently led to a significant decline in invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD). 
      In 2020, the UK NIP reduced the pediatric PCV dosing schedule from two infant 
      doses and one toddler dose (2 + 1) to one infant dose and one toddler dose (1 + 
      1). This analysis evaluated the public health impact of pediatric vaccination 
      with PCV15 versus PCV13 under a 1 + 1 schedule. METHODS: A population-level 
      compartmental model was previously adapted to the UK setting. The impact on the 
      IPD incidence of vaccination with PCV15 versus PCV13 under a 1 + 1 schedule was 
      evaluated over a 20-year time horizon. The uncertainty regarding the vaccine 
      efficacy (VE) of PCV13 and PCV15 under a 1 + 1 schedule was investigated through 
      a probabilistic sensitivity analysis, i.e., the PCV VE under a 1 + 1 schedule was 
      assumed to be 0-24% lower than the PCV VE under a 2 + 1 schedule. RESULTS: 
      Relative to the initial IPD incidence, vaccination with PCV13 and PCV15 under a 1 
      + 1 schedule resulted in the IPD incidence in children <2 years old increasing by 
      11.1% (95% region: 8.4-14.5%) and 3.5% (0.2-7.7%), respectively, over the time 
      horizon. At the end of the time horizon, in the overall population, PCV15 would 
      lead to a 6.0% lower IPD incidence than PCV13 (10.70 IPD cases per 100,000 versus 
      11.38 per 100,000, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: Switching from PCV13 to PCV15 for 
      routine pediatric vaccinations under the 1 + 1 dosing schedule in the UK led to a 
      lower IPD incidence in both the pediatric and overall populations.

TI  - Highly Effective mRNA-LNP Vaccine Against Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) in 
      Multiple Models.
LID - 625 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060625 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The transmembrane fusion (F) protein of RSV plays important roles in 
      RSV pathogenesis as it mediates the fusion between the virus and the target cell 
      membrane. During the fusion process, the F protein transits from a metastable 
      state (prefusion, preF) to a stable state (postfusion, postF) after the merging 
      of the virus and cell membranes. The majority of highly neutralizing antibodies 
      induced by natural infection or immunization target the preF form, which makes it 
      the preferred antigen for vaccine development. METHODS: Here, we designed an 
      effective RSV mRNA vaccine, STR-V003, consisting of mRNA encoding preF protein in 
      lipid nanoparticles (LNPs). The immunogenicity, protection efficacy and toxicity 
      were measured in multiple animal models. RESULTS: STR-V003 demonstrated robust 
      immunogenicity in both mice and cotton rats, inducing high levels of neutralizing 
      antibodies and RSV preF-specific IgG antibodies and significantly reducing the 
      RSV viral loads in the lung and nose tissue of challenged animals. In addition, 
      STR-V003 did not show significant enhancement of lung pathology without causing 
      vaccine-enhanced disease (VED). The repeated dose general toxicology studies and 
      local tolerance studies of STR-V003 were evaluated in rats and non-human primate 
      (NHP). CONCLUSIONS: STR-V003 demonstrates a favorable safety profile and induces 
      robust protective immunity against RSV.

TI  - Effects of Different Adjuvants on the Protective Efficacy of a Subcellular 
      Vaccine Against Chlamydia abortus Infection in Sheep.
LID - 609 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060609 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVE: Recently, we published three studies describing the 
      development and optimization of a new, safe, and efficacious vaccine to protect 
      sheep from ovine enzootic abortion, which is caused by the zoonotic pathogen 
      Chlamydia abortus. The vaccine, which can be delivered through a single 
      inoculation, is based on a detergent-extracted outer membrane protein (chlamydial 
      outer membrane complex or COMC) preparation of the pathogen. This study aimed to 
      optimize the vaccine further by comparing the effects of different adjuvants on 
      protective efficacy. METHODS: We evaluated the effectiveness of three different 
      vaccines (2.5 microg COMC) formulated with one of three adjuvants (Montanide ISA 
      70VG, Montanide ISA 61VG, and QuilA) to reduce the rate of abortion, placental 
      load and pathology, and post-partum vaginal shedding of organisms in comparison 
      to our benchmark 20 microg COMC/Montanide ISA 70 VG vaccine and a challenge control 
      group of animals. The humoral and cellular immunological responses to vaccination 
      and to challenge were also assessed. RESULTS: The two low-dose Montanide 
      formulated vaccines resulted in low abortion rates of 3.2 and 8.1% for ISA 70 VG 
      and ISA 61 VG, respectively, which were comparable to the benchmark vaccine group 
      (2.7%) and considerably lower than the QuilA (23.7%) and challenge control 
      (36.8%) groups. Similarly, the Montanide-adjuvanted groups had much lower 
      bacterial loads (range: 136-431 genome copies) on vaginal swabs post-parturition 
      than the QuilA (8.9 x 10(4) copies) and challenge control (2.4 x 10(5) copies) 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS: The results showed that both Montanide adjuvants are more 
      effective for maximizing COMC vaccine efficacy than the QuilA adjuvant and result 
      in much lower bacterial shedding of the pathogen post-parturition, which is 
      important for minimizing potential transmission to naive animals.

TI  - Immunotherapeutic Blockade of CD47 Increases Virus Neutralization Antibodies.
LID - 602 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060602 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: CD47 is a cell surface glycoprotein moderately expressed 
      in healthy cells and upregulated in cancer and viral infected cells. CD47's 
      interaction with signal regulatory protein alpha (SIRPalpha) inhibits phagocytic 
      cells and its interaction with thrombospondin-1 inhibits T cell response. 
      Experimental evidence has revealed that the blockade of CD47 resulted in the 
      increased activation and function of both innate and adaptive immune cells, 
      therefore exerting antitumoral and antiviral effects. Recent studies have shown 
      that the combination of vaccines and immune checkpoint inhibitors could be a 
      promising approach to increasing vaccine immunogenicity. Here, we investigated 
      the vaccinal effect of anti-CD47 antibodies and discussed the possibilities of 
      combining anti-CD47 treatments with vaccines. METHODS: Using vesicular stomatitis 
      virus (VSV), a widely used replication-competent vaccine vector, we evaluated the 
      impact of the immunotherapeutic blockade of CD47 on cellular, humoral, and 
      protective immunity. We infected C57BL/6 mice with VSV, treated them with 
      anti-CD47 antibodies or an isotype, and evaluated the total immunoglobulin (Ig), 
      IgG neutralizing antibodies, B cell activation, CD8+ T cell effector function, 
      and survival of the mice. RESULTS: We found that the treatments of anti-CD47 
      antibodies led to significantly increased Ig and IgG neutralizing antibody levels 
      compared to the isotype treatment. Flow cytometric analysis of B cells revealed 
      no difference in the number of circulating B cells; however, we observed an 
      increased surface expression of CD80 and CD86 in B cells among anti-CD47-treated 
      mice. Further analysis of the impact of CD47 blockade on T immunity revealed a 
      significantly higher percentage of IFN-gamma(+) CD4 and IFN-gamma(+) CD8 T cells in 
      anti-CD47-treated mice. Upon infecting mice with a lethal VSV dose, we observed a 
      significantly higher survival rate among the anti-CD47-treated mice compared to 
      control mice. CONCLUSIONS: Our results indicate that anti-CD47 treatment induces 
      a stronger cellular and humoral immune response, leading to better protection. As 
      such, immunotherapy by CD47 blockade in combination with vaccines could be a 
      promising approach to improve vaccine efficacy.

TI  - mRNA Vaccine Technology Beyond COVID-19.
LID - 601 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060601 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Since their approval in early 2020, mRNA vaccines have 
      gained significant attention since the COVID-19 pandemic as a potential 
      therapeutic approach to tackle several infectious diseases. This article aims to 
      review the current state of mRNA vaccine technology and its use against other 
      diseases. METHODS: To obtain accurate and reliable data, we carefully searched 
      the clinicaltrial.gov and individual companies' websites for current ongoing 
      clinical trials reports. Also, we accessed different NCBI databases for recent 
      articles or reports of clinical trials, innovative design of mRNA vaccines, and 
      reviews. RESULTS: Significant progress has been made in the design and 
      improvement of mRNA vaccine technology. Currently, there are hundreds of ongoing 
      clinical trials on mRNA vaccines against different cancer types, infectious 
      diseases, and genetic and rare diseases, which showcase the advancement in this 
      technology and their potential therapeutic advantages over traditional vaccine 
      platforms. Finally, we predict what could be a potential future direction in 
      designing more effective mRNA vaccines, particularly against cancer. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The results of many of the ongoing clinical trials have shown significant 
      positive outcomes, with many of the trials already at Phase III. Despite this 
      outlook, however, some have been terminated or withdrawn for several reasons, 
      some of which are not made available. This means that despite the advancement, 
      there is a need for more research and critical evaluation of each innovation to 
      better understand their immunological benefits and long-term effects.

TI  - Overcoming HPV Vaccine Hesitancy in Japan: A Narrative Review of Safety Evidence, 
      Risk Communication, and Policy Approaches.
LID - 590 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060590 [doi]
AB  - Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection remains a principal cause of cervical cancer 
      worldwide. Although large-scale vaccination efforts have substantially lowered 
      HPV infection rates and precancerous lesions, not all regions have achieved high 
      coverage. In Japan, proactive HPV vaccine recommendations were suspended from 
      2013 to 2022 due to concerns over alleged adverse events, causing vaccination 
      rates to drop from over 70% to below 1%. This narrative review synthesized 
      research published from 2014 to 2025 in PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Google 
      Scholar, focusing on English-language studies. Inclusion criteria encompassed 
      analyses of HPV vaccine efficacy or safety, policies related to vaccination in 
      Japan or other countries, and investigations into vaccine hesitancy or media 
      influences. Data were categorized into five thematic areas: historical and policy 
      contexts, evidence of vaccine safety and efficacy, societal drivers of hesitancy, 
      communication strategies, and administrative or clinical interventions. Evidence 
      robustly confirms the HPV vaccine's favorable safety profile, with severe adverse 
      events appearing exceedingly rare. Nonetheless, media sensationalism and limited 
      risk communication in Japan perpetuated mistrust, impeding vaccination uptake. 
      Comparisons with Denmark and Ireland indicate that transparent, interactive risk 
      communication can restore coverage to near-pre-suspension levels. Japan's recent 
      policy reforms, including reinstating proactive recommendations and catch-up 
      initiatives, have begun to reverse vaccination hesitancy. Sustained policy 
      support, evidence-based messaging, and empathetic engagement with communities are 
      central to rebuilding trust in the HPV vaccine. Lessons from best international 
      practices emphasize the importance of multifaceted interventions, collaborative 
      stakeholder engagement, and transparent risk communication to reduce the burden 
      of HPV-related malignancies.

TI  - Construction and Preclinical Evaluation of a Recombinant Attenuated Measles 
      Vaccine Candidate of the H1a Genotype.
LID - 571 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060571 [doi]
AB  - Background: Measles, an acute respiratory infectious disease caused by the 
      measles virus, continues to pose a significant threat to children under five 
      years old worldwide. Despite the availability of effective vaccines, challenges 
      such as insufficient vaccination coverage and antigenic drift contribute to its 
      persistence. Based on a newly isolated wild-type measles virus strain (genotype 
      H1a), designated MVs/Jiangsu.CHN/38.16/1[H1a] (MV-1), this study aims to develop 
      and evaluate a novel recombinant measles virus vaccine candidate designed to 
      enhance immunogenicity and broaden protection against multiple epidemic 
      genotypes. Methods: A recombinant measles virus vaccine candidate, designated 
      rSchwarz/FH(H1a), was developed by incorporating immunogenic genes from the H1a 
      genotype into the backbone of the Schwarz vaccine strain. The genetic stability, 
      safety, and immunogenicity of this vaccine candidate were evaluated in 
      preclinical models. Relevant sample sizes and methodologies were selected to 
      ensure comprehensive assessment of vaccine efficacy against various genotypes 
      (H1a, B3, D8). Results: The rSchwarz/FH(H1a) vaccine candidate demonstrated 
      enhanced immunogenicity, with robust immune responses observed against the 
      targeted genotypes. Additionally, it showed excellent genetic stability and 
      safety profiles, indicating potential for effective use in vaccination programs. 
      Notably, the vaccine provided cross-protection against multiple epidemic 
      genotypes, highlighting its broader application in controlling measles outbreaks. 
      Conclusions: Our findings suggest that the rSchwarz/FH(H1a) vaccine candidate 
      represents a promising advancement in measles vaccine development. It has the 
      potential to strengthen current measles vaccination strategies by providing 
      improved immunogenicity and broader protection against different circulating 
      genotypes. Further clinical trials are warranted to confirm these promising 
      preclinical results.

      such as mutation risks and short efficacy. This study explores cationic bovine 
      serum albumin (BSA) polyamine nanoparticles (NPs) for delivering IBV spike 
      protein mRNA, aiming to develop a safer and more effective vaccine. Methods: A 
      BSA-based nanoparticle system was designed with positive surface charges and 
      characterized using dynamic light scattering (DLS), Zetasizer, and transmission 
      electron microscopy (TEM). Its cytotoxicity, cellular uptake, and ability to 
      deliver IBV spike protein mRNA were evaluated in macrophage-like chicken cell 
      lines (HD11), followed by immunogenicity studies in SPF chickens to assess immune 
      responses. Results: The study demonstrated successful binding and transfection 
      efficiency of the in vitro transcription (IVT)-mRNA complexed with the NPs, which 
      was enhanced with chloroquine. Immunogenicity studies in SPF chickens showed a 
      significant increase in antibody titers in chickens vaccinated with the mRNA 
      vaccine compared to the PBS control, indicating an effective immune response 
      against the IBV S protein. Furthermore, the neutralization index doubled after a 
      higher-dose mRNA booster with chloroquine, and PBMCs from immunized chickens 
      exhibited a threefold higher stimulation index than the PBS control. Conclusions: 
      BSA-based NPs effectively deliver IBV spike protein mRNA, enhancing immune 
      responses and offering a promising strategy for a safer, more effective IBV 
      vaccine.

TI  - Long-Term Immuno-Response and Risk of Breakthrough Infection After SARS-CoV-2 
      Vaccination in Kidney Transplantation.
LID - 566 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060566 [doi]
AB  - Background: Kidney transplant (KTx) recipients exhibit impaired responses to 
      SARS-CoV-2 vaccination. Correlates of vaccine-induced immunity and risk factors 
      for breakthrough infection are not fully defined. This study evaluated the 
      humoral response trajectories and determinants of breakthrough infection in KTx 
      recipients. Methods: KTx recipients received two doses of the BNT162b2 mRNA 
      vaccine three weeks apart and a booster after six months. Patients were 
      categorized based on pre-vaccination status: previous COVID-19 disease (DIS), 
      asymptomatic SARS-CoV-2 infection (INF), or infection-naive (NEG). Serum 
      anti-spike antibody titers were assessed at baseline, before the second dose, and 
      at 1, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Linear mixed models and survival analyses were 
      performed. Results: Of 326 enrolled patients, 189 with complete time-point data 
      were included in the longitudinal analysis. Antibodies were detectable in 89% of 
      DIS/INF at baseline and 91% before the second dose, but were negligible in NEG. 
      In NEG, the seropositivity increased after vaccination and booster, reaching 78% 
      at 12 months. Age (-5% per year, p < 0.001) and BMI (+10% per unit, p = 0.004) 
      influenced titers; antimetabolites and steroids had strong negative effects 
      (-70%, p = 0.005; -84%, p = 0.001). Breakthrough infections occurred in 104 
      (31.9%); 40% were asymptomatic, and 2 patients died. An mTOR inhibitor was 
      associated with a reduced infection risk (OR 0.27 [CI: 0.09-0.70], p = 0.009). 
      Higher antibody titers correlated with delayed infection (p = 0.063). 
      Conclusions: In KTx patients, humoral response to SARS-CoV-2 vaccination is 
      limited in infection-naive patients but improved by booster dosing; the hybrid 
      immunity is more effective. Immunosuppressive regimens influence the immune 
      response, and mTOR inhibitors may protect against breakthrough infection.

TI  - Adjuvanted RNA Origami-A Tunable Peptide Assembly Platform for Constructing 
      Cancer Nanovaccines.
LID - 560 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060560 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Cancer peptide vaccines represent a promising strategy to 
      develop targeted and personalized treatments for cancer patients. While tumor 
      peptides alone are insufficient in mounting effective immune responses, the 
      addition of adjuvants can enhance their immunogenicity. Nanoparticle delivery 
      systems have been explored as vaccine carriers to incorporate both adjuvants and 
      peptides. One such nanoparticle is RNA origami (RNA-OG), a nucleic acid 
      nanostructure that is programmed to form different sizes and shapes. Our designed 
      RNA-OG can incorporate various biomolecules and has intrinsic adjuvant activity 
      by acting as a toll-like receptor 3 agonist. We previously showed that the RNA-OG 
      functions as an adjuvanted, carrier-free vaccine platform to assemble peptides. 
      Although effective, only a fixed number of peptides (13) could be covalently 
      linked to each RNA-OG. METHODS: Here, we developed a simple physical assembly 
      strategy to attach polylysine-linked neopeptides onto RNA-OG so that the number 
      of peptides per RNA-OG could be readily tuned and tested for their 
      immunogenicity. RESULTS: Although the vaccines with a high number of peptides, 
      i.e., 100-200 peptides/RNA-OG, led to greater peptide presentation by bone 
      marrow-derived dendritic cells, they failed to mount effective CD8(+) T cell 
      responses against engrafted tumor cells, probably owing to an induction of early 
      T cell exhaustion. Interestingly, the same vaccine format with a low number of 
      peptides, i.e., 10-15 peptides/RNA-OG, enhanced CD8(+) T cell responses without 
      provoking T cell exhaustion in tumor-bearing mice, leading to strong protective 
      anti-tumor immunity. In comparison, the covalently assembled RNA-OG-peptide 
      vaccine, having a similarly low peptide dosage, offered the highest therapeutic 
      efficacy. Thus, our RNA-OG nanostructure provides a simple and tunable platform 
      for peptide loading to optimize vaccine efficacy. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings have 
      significant implications for peptide vaccine design regarding peptide dosages and 
      structural stability of RNA-OG complexed with peptides, which could guide the 
      development of more effective peptide vaccines for cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - Mucosal and Serum Neutralization Immune Responses Elicited by COVID-19 mRNA 
      Vaccination in Vaccinated and Breakthrough-Infection Individuals: A Longitudinal 
      Study from Louisville Cohort.
LID - 559 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060559 [doi]
AB  - Background/Objectives: The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by severe acute respiratory 
      syndrome coronavirus type-2 (SARS-CoV-2), has resulted in 777 million cases 
      worldwide. Various vaccines have been approved to control the spread of COVID-19, 
      with mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) being widely used in the USA. We 
      conducted a prospective longitudinal study to analyze the immune response 
      elicited by two/three and four doses of monovalent mRNA vaccines in both 
      vaccinated individuals and those who experienced breakthrough infections. 
      Participants were stratified into different age groups: 18-40, 41-60, and over 60 
      years. Methods: We assessed cross-variant neutralization responses in two 
      cohorts-Cohort I: n = 167 (serum), Cohort II: n = 92 (serum and nasal swab) 
      samples-using infectious virus microneutralization assay (MN) and antibody (IgG 
      or IgA) binding ELISA titers to the spike protein receptor binding domain (RBD). 
      Samples were collected from the Louisville Metro-Jefferson County Co-Immunity 
      Project, a federally funded, population-based study for the surveillance of 
      SARS-CoV-2 in Jefferson County, Kentucky during 2020-2022, involving both health 
      care workers and a local community. Results: Individuals who received two doses 
      of the mRNA vaccine exhibited reduced neutralization against Beta, Delta, and 
      Omicron BA.1 variants compared to wildtype Wuhan, with further decline observed 
      six months post-booster vaccination. However, individuals who experienced natural 
      COVID-19 infection (breakthrough) after receiving two vaccine doses showed 
      enhanced neutralization and antibody responses, particularly against Omicron 
      BA.1. Following the 3rd dose, antibodies and neutralization responses were 
      restored. Among triple-vaccinated individuals, reduced neutralization was 
      observed against Omicron variants BA.1, BA.5, and BA.2 compared to Wuhan. 
      Neutralization responses were better against BA.2 variant compared to BA.1 and 
      BA.5. However, individuals who received three doses of vaccine and experienced a 
      breakthrough infection (n = 45) elicited significantly higher neutralizing 
      antibodies responses against all Omicron subvariants compared to vaccinated 
      individuals. Interestingly, nasal swab samples collected from volunteers with 
      breakthrough infection showed significantly elevated spike-reactive mucosal IgA 
      antibodies and enhanced cross neutralization against BA.1, BA.2, and BA.5 
      compared to individuals who received only three vaccine doses. Conclusions: mRNA 
      vaccination elicits a strong systemic immune response by boosting serum 
      neutralizing antibodies (NAb), although this protection wanes over time, allowing 
      new variants to escape neutralization. Breakthrough individuals have extra 
      enrichment in nasal NAb offering protection against emerging variants. This 
      longitudinal immune profiling underscores the strengthening of pandemic 
      preparedness and supports the development of durable mucosal vaccines against 
      respiratory infectious disease.

LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061332 [doi]
LID - 1332
AB  - The global pork production sector continues to experience substantial financial 
      burdens attributable to porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus 
      (PRRSV) infections. Despite the current epidemiological landscape in which 
      NADC30-like strains predominate alongside cocirculating diverse PRRSV subtypes, 
      highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) remains a persistent threat. Furthermore, 
      currently available commercial PRRS vaccine formulations exhibit restricted 
      heterologous protection efficacy. The development of novel mRNA-based vaccines 
      represents a promising strategy for PRRS mitigation protocols. In response to 
      these epidemiological challenges, an HP-PRRSV strain (Lineage 8), designated as 
      JX021, was isolated and characterized in this study. Pathogenicity experiments 
      confirmed that JX021 induces severe clinical symptoms in piglets. Moreover, by 
      combining immunoinformatics and literature-guided approaches, critical antigenic 
      epitopes on HP-PRRSV (represented by the JXA1 strain) structural proteins were 
      identified, enabling the design and synthesis of a multiepitope mRNA vaccine. The 
      survival of piglets immunized with the mRNA vaccine was higher than that of the 
      inactivated vaccine immunization group and the PBS group. Compared with the 
      inactivated vaccine group, the mRNA vaccine group presented reductions in viremia 
      and lung lesions. These findings provide new insights into the design and 
      development of further PRRS vaccine research.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the transformative potential of messenger 
      RNA (mRNA) vaccines in biomedicine, thanks to their rapid design, scalable 
      production, and strong immunogenicity. Nonetheless, their widespread adoption 
      remains hindered by challenges related to sequence optimization, delivery 
      efficiency, thermostability, and safety. This review systematically summarizes 
      recent progress in mRNA vaccine development, including advances in molecular 
      engineering, delivery platforms, adjuvant properties, and artificial intelligence 
      (AI)-driven predictive modeling. It covers codon optimization, nucleoside 
      modification, untranslated region (UTR) engineering, and novel structural formats 
      such as self-amplifying and circular mRNAs. The review also compares various 
      delivery systems-including lipid nanoparticles, cationic polymers, and virus-like 
      particles-focusing on their physicochemical characteristics and translational 
      applicability. Particular attention is given to the intrinsic adjuvant properties 
      of mRNA molecules and their delivery vehicles, as well as strategies for 
      incorporating exogenous adjuvants to modulate immune responses. Furthermore, the 
      article provides a succinct overview of key preclinical and clinical advancements 
      in mRNA vaccines targeting major infectious diseases (e.g., HIV, influenza, RSV, 
      rabies) and tumor-associated antigens (e.g., HPV). This review is among the first 
      to highlight breakthroughs in the application of AI for antigen screening, mRNA 
      sequence optimization, lipid component selection, and vaccine stability 
      prediction. Finally, the review addresses current platform limitations and 
      proposes future directions for interdisciplinary collaboration, offering both 
      theoretical insights and practical recommendations for the safe and effective 
      implementation of next-generation mRNA vaccines.

AB  - Tuberculosis (TB) remains a leading global cause of death, with approximately 1.3 
      million fatalities annually. While males are more susceptible to TB, the 
      underlying immune differences and their impact on vaccine efficacy are not fully 
      understood. In this study, we vaccinated male and female C57BL/6 mice with BCG 
      and 2 recombinant derivatives, VPM1002 and BCGDeltaBCG1419c, and assessed their 
      protection against Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) HN878. While all 3 vaccines 
      showed comparable efficacy in females, BCG did not protect males from Mtb-induced 
      death. Instead, recombinant vaccines provided improved protection in males. 
      Vaccination of males with BCGDeltaBCG1419c, but not BCG, enhanced CD8 T-cell and 
      B-cell recall responses in vaccine-draining lymph nodes, and reduced lung 
      inflammation after Mtb challenge. These findings underscore the impact of sex 
      differences on vaccine efficacy and suggest that future research should consider 
      sex as a biological variable to optimize TB vaccination strategies.

TI  - Generation of Interferon-gamma-Expressing Single-Cycle Viral Hemorrhagic Septicemia 
      Virus (rVHSV-A-IFNgamma-DeltaG) and Potential as a Vaccine in Olive Flounder 
      (Paralichthys olivaceus).
PG  - 106
LID - 10.1007/s10126-025-10483-4 [doi]
AB  - Single-cycle viruses generated by the deletion of gene(s) essential for viral 
      replication in the genome can be a way to enhance the safety of attenuated 
      virus-based vaccines because single-cycle viruses can infect cells only once and 
      cannot produce infective viral particles. In the present study, not only to 
      guarantee safety as a prophylactic vaccine but also to enhance the protective 
      efficacy, a single-cycle viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) lacking the G 
      gene and containing olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus) interferon-gamma (IFNgamma) 
      ORF between N and P genes of the viral genome (rVHSV-A-IFNgamma-DeltaG) was rescued using 
      reverse genetic technology, and its protective potential was evaluated through 
      the immunization of olive flounder. In the challenge experiment, the cumulative 
      mortality in the control group reached 80%, while groups of fish immunized with 
      various doses of rVHSV-A-IFNgamma-DeltaG (ranging from 1 x 10(3) to 1 x 10(5) pfu/fish) 
      showed no mortalities. In contrast, fish immunized with various doses of rVHSV-DeltaG 
      exhibited 0-20% mortality in a dose-dependent manner. Serum ELISA analysis 
      revealed that groups receiving the highest doses of rVHSV-DeltaG and rVHSV-A-IFNgamma-DeltaG 
      showed significantly elevated titers compared to the control group. Although no 
      statistically significant differences in ELISA titers were observed among groups 
      immunized with lower doses of recombinant VHSVs, particularly at 1 x 10(3) 
      pfu/fish, and the control group, the markedly higher protection compared to the 
      control group suggests that these single-cycle viruses possess a limited capacity 
      to induce antibody responses, yet are capable of conferring protective immunity 
      against VHSV independently of humoral mechanisms. Moreover, the complete 
      protection achieved with low-dose immunization of rVHSV-A-IFNgamma-DeltaG indicates its 
      strong potential as a highly effective prophylactic vaccine candidate.

TI  - Novel Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa MAPS vaccine combining O 
      polysaccharides and pathogen-specific proteins.
PG  - e0080725
LID - 10.1128/mbio.00807-25 [doi]
AB  - Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) are leading causes of 
      healthcare-associated and community-acquired infections. Despite decades of 
      efforts, there are no licensed vaccines for either pathogen. The surface O 
      polysaccharides (OPS) of Klebsiella pneumoniae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa are 
      essential virulence factors for these bacteria and are targets of protective 
      antibacterial antibodies. The multiple antigen presenting system (MAPS) vaccine 
      platform was used to create a multivalent Klebsiella/Pseudomonas vaccine in which 
      the surface OPS of four Klebsiella and eight Pseudomonas strains were linked to a 
      high MW biotinylated Klebsiella oxytoca (KO) K19 capsular polysaccharide backbone 
      and subsequently linked to pathogen-specific fusion proteins, consisting of 
      Klebsiella MrkA, the Pseudomonas flagellin B D2 subunit, and PcrV. We show here 
      that these MAPS complexes incorporating KP and PA OPS, as well as 
      pathogen-specific proteins, were highly immunogenic in rabbits and mice and 
      induced functionally active antibodies in vitro and in murine animal 
      models.IMPORTANCEInfections caused by Klebsiella pneumoniae (KP) and Pseudomonas 
      aeruginosa (PA) are widely recognized to be of ""urgent"" and ""serious"" concern, in 
      part because of their widespread antimicrobial resistance. To date, there is no 
      licensed vaccine for either pathogen. We developed a novel multiple antigen 
      presenting system (MAPS) vaccine platform that contains eight O polysaccharides 
      (OPS) of PA and four OPS of KP, which will cover over 80% of clinical infections 
      with these pathogens. In addition, this vaccine includes three pathogen-relevant 
      proteins acting both as carrier proteins to provide T cell help for these 
      polysaccharides as well as to elicit functionally active antibodies that may also 
      protect against KP and PA infection. The use of pathogen-relevant proteins that 
      may contribute to vaccine efficacy in place of the more traditional carrier 
      proteins is a novel concept. The MAPS vaccine platform also generates Th17 and 
      Th1 responses. This KP/PA MAPS vaccine may prevent infection with these pathogens 
      and reduce their transmissibility.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Misinformation has played a significant role in shaping public 
      attitudes toward COVID-19 vaccines, contributing to vaccine hesitancy. This study 
      examines the relationship between misinformation exposure and vaccine hesitancy, 
      focusing on the mediating roles of perceived vaccine safety and efficacy. 
      Additionally, it explores how trust in misinformation influences these 
      relationships. METHODS: A cross-sectional survey was conducted between March and 
      May 2021 across four university campuses in the southeastern United States 
      (N = 819). Participants (Mean age = 20.55, SD = 2.85) were predominantly female 
      (N = 525, 64.1%). Mediation and moderated mediation analyses were performed using 
      Hayes' PROCESS Model 4 and Model 8. RESULTS: Findings revealed that greater 
      exposure to vaccine misinformation was associated with higher vaccine hesitancy. 
      This relationship was mediated by increased perceptions of vaccine unsafety and 
      reduced beliefs in vaccine efficacy. Additionally, trust in misinformation 
      strengthened the indirect effect through perceived vaccine unsafety, reinforcing 
      hesitancy among individuals who found misinformation more credible. CONCLUSION: 
      This study highlights the critical role of misinformation in shaping vaccine 
      hesitancy. By identifying the psychological mechanisms underlying this 
      relationship, these insights can inform strategies to counter misinformation, 
      improve public trust in vaccines, and enhance health communication in future 
      public health crises.

TI  - Transcriptomic and miRNA Signatures of ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 Vaccine Response Using 
      Machine Learning.
LID - 10.3390/life15060981 [doi]
LID - 981
AB  - Vaccination with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 is an important countermeasure to fight the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. This vaccine enhances human immunoprotection against 
      SARS-CoV-2 by inducing an immune response against the SARS-CoV-2 S protein. 
      However, the immune-related genes induced by vaccination remain to be identified. 
      This study employs feature ranking algorithms, an incremental feature selection 
      method, and classification algorithms to analyze transcriptomic data from an 
      experimental group vaccinated with the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and a control 
      group vaccinated with the MenACWY meningococcal vaccine. According to different 
      time points, vaccination status, and SARS-CoV-2 infection status, the 
      transcriptomic data was divided into five groups, including a pre-vaccination 
      group, ChAdOx1-onset group, MenACWY-onset group, ChAdOx1-7D group, and MenACWY-7D 
      group. Each group contained samples with 13,383 RNA features and 1662 small RNA 
      features. The results identified key genes that could indicate the efficacy of 
      the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine, and a classifier was developed to classify samples 
      into the above groups. Additionally, effective classification rules were 
      established to distinguish between different vaccination statuses. It was found 
      that subjects vaccinated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine and infected with 
      SARS-CoV-2 were characterized by up-regulation of HIST1H3G expression and 
      down-regulation of CASP10 expression. In addition, IGHG1, FOXM1, and CASP10 genes 
      were strongly associated with ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine efficacy. Compared with 
      previous omics-driven studies, the machine learning algorithms used in this study 
      were able to analyze transcriptome data faster and more comprehensively to 
      identify potential markers associated with vaccine effect and investigate ChAdOx1 
      nCoV-19 vaccine-induced gene expression changes. These observations contribute to 
      an understanding of the immune protection and inflammatory responses induced by 
      the ChAdOx1 nCoV-19 vaccine during symptomatic episodes and provide a rationale 
      for improving vaccine efficacy.

LID - 10.3390/ani15121728 [doi]
LID - 1728
AB  - Viral hemorrhagic septicemia virus (VHSV) is a major pathogen in Paralichthys 
      olivaceus (olive flounder) aquaculture, necessitating effective vaccines and 
      evaluation methods. This study assessed immune responses following 
      intraperitoneal administration of an inactivated VHSV vaccine and identified 
      surrogate markers of vaccine efficacy. Fish were sampled weekly over 8 weeks. 
      Antigen-specific antibody titers were measured by ELISA, and the expression of 
      seven immune-related genes (CD4, CD8, CD28, IgM, Mx, IFN, and IL-1beta) was analyzed 
      in the spleen, kidney, liver, and gill by qPCR. The vaccinated group showed 84% 
      relative survival, while unvaccinated fish experienced 100% mortality. Antibody 
      titers peaked at 4 weeks post-vaccination, aligning with elevated IgM expression 
      in the spleen and kidney. CD4 (kidney) and CD28 (spleen) expression strongly 
      correlated with antibody titers (r = 0.854 and 0.796, respectively), whereas 
      IL-1beta, IFN, and Mx showed moderate associations in specific tissues. These 
      findings indicate that CD4, CD28, and IgM may serve as molecular indicators of 
      humoral immune responses specifically following inactivated VHSV vaccination in 
      olive flounder (Paralichthys olivaceus). Combining gene expression profiling with 
      antibody analysis offers a non-lethal, practical approach to evaluating vaccine 
      efficacy in aquaculture.

TI  - Design and Validation of a Multi-Epitope mRNA Vaccine Construct Against Human 
      Monkeypox Virus (hMPXV) by Annotating Protein of Intracellular Mature Virus (IMV) 
      Form of hMPXV.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines13061439 [doi]
LID - 1439
AB  - Background: hMPXV poses a major public health risk due to its human-to-human 
      transmissibility, severe complications, especially in immunocompromised 
      individuals, and global spread, necessitating effective surveillance and 
      stringent prophylactic measures to mitigate its colossal impact. Objective: The 
      study aimed to annotate hMPXV(IMV) proteins to propose a potential reverse 
      vaccinology-based vaccine against hMPXV. Methods: The target MPXV(IMV) protein's 
      sequences, formatted in FASTA, were sourced from genome/proteome databases 
      (BV-BRC and UniProt) (accessed on 6 November 2024), followed by CD-Hit-based 
      redundancy removal. Epitope prediction for B-cells (lymphocytes), cytotoxic 
      T-cells or cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs), and helper T-cells (HTLs) was executed 
      using ABCpred, IEDB's ANNs 4.0, and an artificial neural network-based alignment 
      tool (NN-align 2.3)/ML-based tool (NetMHCII 2.3). Various immunoinformatics 
      filters (antigenicity, toxicity, and allergenicity) were applied to substantiate 
      the potency and safety of the formulated vaccine candidate. The constructed 
      vaccine's physiochemical and structural features (secondary and tertiary), with 
      structural stability (confirmed by molecular docking followed by dynamic 
      simulation with TLRs (TLR4 & TLR2) and MHCs), were determined. Additionally, 
      cloning (using pET-28a(+) vector) was conducted to verify the vaccine's 
      expression potential and translation efficiency. The construct's population 
      coverage was also ascertained. Results: The MPXV-2-Beta vaccine constructs, of 
      the six initially designed constructs, was identified as the most promising 
      candidate, signifying nonallergenic profile and nontoxic features, with a 
      predicted antigenicity score (PAS) = 0.7202, 407 residues, a molecular weight of 
      43,102.1 Da, pI of 9.2, and favorable stability parameters (AI: 65.65, GRAVY: 
      -0.597, I-i: 25.92). It showed high solubility (score: 0.942). The ProSA Z-score 
      of -9.38 confirmed the structural stability, reliability, and precision of the 
      MPXV-2-Beta 3D model, which is comparable to experimental structures. 
      Furthermore, 98.8% of all the residues nested within favored or allowed regions 
      in a critical Ramachandran plot signified the model's exceptional structural 
      integrity and quality. Docking and dynamic simulation of MPXV-2-Beta with TLRs 
      (TLR4 & TLR2) and MHCs demonstrated stiffer docking stability (strong polar and 
      nonpolar interaction) and negative eigenvalue value (during dynamic simulation), 
      suggesting its ability to enhance immune receptor activation under physiological 
      conditions. MPXV-2-Beta was predicted to trigger a robust immune response (IR) 
      with comprehensive world population coverage (98.55%, SD = 10.41). Conclusions: 
      Based on the evaluated parameters, the MPXV-2-Beta designed in this study 
      exhibited significant potential as an effective candidate against hMPXV. This 
      study establishes a foundation for developing an efficient vaccine against hMPXV, 
      requiring further experimental and clinical validation to confirm computational 
      findings.

TI  - High-Dose Tranexamic Acid Enhances Circulating Neutrophil Extracellular Traps and 
      Thrombus in Thrombosis Mouse Model.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines13061284 [doi]
LID - 1284
AB  - Background/Objectives: Tranexamic acid (TXA) reduces mortality in patients with 
      massive hemorrhage by inhibiting fibrinolysis. However, it is associated with an 
      increased risk of thrombosis. The activation of neutrophil extracellular traps 
      (NETs) has been implicated in the formation of thrombosis. This study 
      investigated the effects of tranexamic acid on circulating and localized NETs, 
      neutrophils, platelets, and the vascular endothelium in a mouse model of 
      thrombosis. Methods: A ferric chloride-induced thrombosis mouse model was used 
      and divided into five groups: a Control group that received intraperitoneal 
      phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and four experimental groups that received 
      intraperitoneal tranexamic acid at doses of 5 mg/kg, 10 mg/kg, 20 mg/kg, and 30 
      mg/kg, respectively. To evaluate the expression of circulating and localized 
      NETs, neutrophils, platelets, vascular endothelial cells, fibrinogen, and 
      D-dimer, the following markers were analyzed: myeloperoxidase (MPO), neutrophil 
      marker, cluster of differentiation (CD)31, CD34, fibrinogen alpha-chain, and D-dimer. 
      These markers were assessed using flow cytometry, immunohistofluorescence 
      staining, and Western blot analysis. The primary endpoint was the differential 
      expression of anti-MPO antibody among the groups. Results: In total, data from 20 
      thrombosis mouse models were analyzed. For each group, four samples were assessed 
      by flow cytometry, and three samples by immunohistofluorescence staining and 
      Western blot analysis, respectively. In the flow cytometric analysis, circulating 
      anti-MPO antibody expression was significantly higher in the TXA 20 and TXA 30 
      groups compared to the Control group (p = 0.001 and p = 0.001, respectively). 
      Immunohistofluorescence staining revealed that D-dimer expression in the 
      thrombotic femoral artery was significantly lower in the TXA 5, TXA 10, and TXA 
      20 groups compared to the Control group (p = 0.005; p = 0.018; p = 0.004, 
      respectively), but significantly higher in the TXA 30 group than in the Control 
      group (p = 0.044). Similarly, the expression of anti-fibrinogen antibody was 
      significantly lower in the TXA 5, TXA 10, and TXA 20 groups compared to the 
      Control group (p = 0.038; p = 0.003; p = 0.041, respectively). Western blot 
      analysis showed no significant differences in the expression of anti-Ly6B.2, 
      anti-fibrinogen, and anti-CD31 antibodies among the groups. Conclusions: The 
      present study suggests that high-dose tranexamic acid (30 mg/kg) administration 
      may increase circulating NETs and localized D-dimer levels, indicating a higher 
      potential for thrombosis in a thrombosis mouse model. These findings imply that 
      the prothrombotic effects of tranexamic acid may be dose-dependent and could vary 
      based on underlying disease conditions. Therefore, the careful dosage adjustment 
      of tranexamic acid may be necessary, particularly in patients at risk of 
      thrombosis.

      Future Directions.

LID - 1270
AB  - The journey toward a viable malaria vaccine, initiated in 1965, reached a major 
      milestone in 2021 with the WHO's endorsement of RTS,S/AS01, a recombinant 
      protein-based malaria vaccine. This progress continued with the 2023 approval of 
      the R21/Matrix-M vaccine, which is more cost-effective, more potent due it is 
      higher protein content, and easier to manufacture. Though these achievements 
      signal hope, malaria's intricate life cycle and its prevalence in underprivileged 
      regions make vaccine development and equitable distribution challenging. This 
      review explains the lifecycle of malaria and explores the evolution of various 
      treatment strategies aimed at reducing malaria-related mortality. This scoping 
      review aims to provide a comprehensive overview of malaria vaccines, examining 
      their development, efficacy, safety, and implementation challenges. Using a 
      structured literature search across PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus, we 
      identified key themes related to malaria vaccines trials, policy implications, 
      and future research needs. Peer-reviewed publications on PubMed, Scopus, and Web 
      of Science from 1970 to 2024 were searched without any limitations. Search and 
      Boolean search terms were modified to include terms like ""malaria vaccines"", 
      ""malaria vaccination"", ""malaria immunisation"", ""malaria immunisation AND 
      malaria-endemic countries"", ""malaria endemic low-income countries AND malaria 
      control"", ""malaria public health control"", ""malaria chemoprophylaxis AND early 
      diagnosis of malaria"", ""screening for malaria"", and ""laboratory diagnosis of 
      malaria in endemic countries"" in order to find pertinent studies. Preliminary 
      insights suggest that although vaccines are crucial, comprehensive strategies 
      involving health education, hygiene, and timely medical intervention remain 
      essential to malaria control.

TI  - Probiotic-Vaccine Synergy in Fish Aquaculture: Exploring Microbiome-Immune 
      Interactions for Enhanced Vaccine Efficacy.
LID - 10.3390/biology14060629 [doi]
LID - 629
AB  - The rapid expansion of aquaculture is vital for global food security, yet it 
      faces persistent threats from disease outbreaks, vaccine inefficacy, and 
      antibiotic overuse, all of which undermine sustainability. Conventional vaccines 
      often fail to induce robust mucosal immunity, spurring interest in probiotics as 
      adjuvants to enhance immunogenicity. Probiotics such as Bacillus subtilis and 
      Lactobacillus casei modulate fish microbiomes, fortify mucosal barriers, and 
      activate innate immune responses via mechanisms including Toll-like receptor 
      signaling and cytokine production. These actions prime the host environment for 
      prolonged adaptive immunity, improving antigen uptake and pathogen clearance. 
      Experimental advances-such as Bacillus subtilis-engineered spores increasing 
      survival rates to 86% in Vibrio anguillarum-challenged European 
      seabass-demonstrate the potential of this synergy. Innovations in delivery 
      systems, including chitosan-alginate microcapsules and synbiotic formulations, 
      further address oral vaccine degradation, enhancing practicality. Probiotics also 
      suppress pathogens while enriching beneficial gut taxa, amplifying mucosal IgA 
      and systemic IgM responses. However, challenges such as strain-specific 
      variability, environmental dependencies, and unresolved ecological risks persist. 
      Optimizing host-specific probiotics and advancing multi-omics research is 
      critical to unlocking this synergy fully. Integrating probiotic mechanisms with 
      vaccine design offers a pathway toward antibiotic-free aquaculture, aligning with 
      One Health principles. Realizing this vision demands interdisciplinary 
      collaboration to standardize protocols, validate field efficacy, and align 
      policies with ecological sustainability. Probiotic-vaccine strategies represent 
      not merely a scientific advance but an essential evolution for resilient, 
      ecologically balanced aquaculture systems.

TI  - Repeated COVID-19 Vaccination as a Poor Prognostic Factor in Pancreatic Cancer: A 
      Retrospective, Single-Center Cohort Study.
LID - 10.3390/cancers17122006 [doi]
LID - 2006
AB  - Background/Objectives: The COVID-19 vaccine is a significant technological 
      advancement with widespread global use. However, its effect on cancer immunity, 
      particularly with repeated vaccinations, remains unclear. We aimed to investigate 
      the relationship between repeated vaccinations and pancreatic cancer (PC) 
      prognosis. Additionally, we examined serum IgG4 levels, known to be an immune 
      suppressor which increases with repeated vaccinations. Methods: We 
      retrospectively examined the effect of vaccination on survival in 272 PC patients 
      diagnosed at our hospital from January 2018 to November 2023 and analyzed 
      prognostic factors, including IgG4 levels in 96 PC patients. Immunohistochemistry 
      for Foxp3 in the tumor tissue was performed, and the serum IgG4 level was 
      measured. Serum samples from 79 patients with benign and malignant diseases, 
      including PC, were collected between September and November 2023, and the 
      spike-specific IgG4 level was determined using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay. Results: The overall survival (OS) of PC patients was shortened in those 
      vaccinated three times or more, and the total serum IgG4 levels increased with 
      the number of vaccinations. Of note, OS was significantly shorter in the high 
      IgG4 group, and Foxp3-positive cells in the tumor tissues were increased. 
      Repeated vaccinations increased the spike-specific IgG4 levels, and a positive 
      correlation was observed between spike-specific IgG4 and the total IgG4. 
      Conclusions: These findings highlight repeated vaccination as a poor prognostic 
      factor in PC patients and suggest that IgG4 is induced by repeated vaccination 
      and may be associated with a poor prognosis in these patients.

TI  - Periodic Boosters of COVID-19 Vaccines Do Not Affect the Safety and Efficacy of 
      Immune Checkpoint Inhibitors for Advanced Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer: A 
      Longitudinal Analysis of the Vax-On-Third Study.
LID - 10.3390/cancers17121948 [doi]
LID - 1948
AB  - BACKGROUND: Increasing evidence suggests that the immunogenicity of COVID-19 mRNA 
      vaccines might influence the efficacy of immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). 
      Current studies have not considered the impact of additional vaccinations, which 
      are now recommended as a preventive strategy against SARS-CoV-2 infection for 
      cancer patients receiving active treatments. Consequently, we leveraged the 
      prospective monitoring from the Vax-On-Third study to explore whether periodic 
      mRNA vaccine boosters administered around the start of ICIs could influence the 
      rates of immune-related adverse events (irAEs) and survival outcomes in patients 
      with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). METHODS: Our study included 
      patients with a histological diagnosis of metastatic NSCLC and available PD-L1 
      tumor proportion score (TPS), who had undergone at least two cycles of upfront 
      treatment with pembrolizumab, cemiplimab, or their combination with 
      platinum-based chemotherapy. Patients who received any additional mRNA-based 
      vaccine doses within 60 days before to 30 days after starting ICIs accounted for 
      the exposed cohort. Those who declined further boosters formed the reference 
      cohort. We analyzed differences in irAE frequencies, progression-free survival 
      (PFS), and overall survival (OS) using univariate and multivariate analyses. 
      RESULTS: Between 27 November 2021 and 31 March 2024, we enrolled 226 eligible 
      patients. The exposed cohort consisted of 112 patients who had received either a 
      third or fourth dose of tozinameran or a bivalent booster. Based on PD-L1 
      expression levels, 93 (41%) and 133 (59%) patients received single-agent ICIs 
      (PD-L1 TPS >/= 50%) or combination regimens (PD-L1 TPS < 50%), respectively. 
      Propensity-score matching using comprehensive criteria resulted in two cohorts of 
      102 patients each, with an optimal balance of prognostic factors. A thorough 
      analysis of any grade irAEs showed no significant differences between the 
      cohorts. A longitudinal survival assessment with a median follow-up of 22.8 (95% 
      CI 19.2-26.0) months showed no difference between the cohorts. The median PFS for 
      the reference and exposed cohorts was 7.5 (95% CI 5.9-9.1) and 8.2 (95% CI 
      6.2-10.2) months, respectively (p = 0.408; HR 0.88 [95% CI 0.66-1.18]). The 
      median OS for the reference and exposed cohorts was 10.5 (95% CI 7.9-13.0) and 
      13.8 (95% CI 12.0-15.5) months, respectively (p = 0.170; HR 0.81 [95% CI 
      0.59-1.09]). Multivariate analysis confirmed that receiving additional mRNA 
      vaccine boosters did not significantly affect the risk of disease progression or 
      mortality. Univariate analysis within the subgroup of patients with high PD-L1 
      TPS who received single-agent ICIs showed a significant OS advantage for patients 
      in the exposed cohort (9.7 [95% CI 8.1-11.2] vs. 18.6 [95% CI 13.5-23.6] months; 
      p = 0.034; HR 0.59 [95% CI 0.36-0.96]). CONCLUSION: After optimally balancing 
      prognostic factors, regular mRNA vaccine boosters at the onset of ICIs did not 
      impact the safety and survival of patients with advanced NSCLC. The improved 
      outcome observed in patients with high PD-L1 expression levels aligns with 
      previous findings and warrants further investigation.

AB  - Leptospirosis is a global zoonotic disease affecting humans, wildlife, companion, 
      and domestic animals. Incidental hosts can contract the disease directly or 
      indirectly from asymptomatic reservoir hosts, most commonly small rodents. The 
      Golden Syrian hamster is recognized as the dominant rodent model for acute 
      leptospirosis because the animals are susceptible to many serovars and are used 
      to maintain laboratory strains and test bacterin vaccine efficacy. However, 
      hamsters are primarily used in survival-based studies, and investigations into 
      host immune response and disease pathogenesis are limited. We found that 
      Peromyscus leucopus white-footed deer mice are susceptible to acute 
      leptospirosis, and thus might be an alternative rodent model. Furthermore, 
      similar to hamsters, deer mice produce circulating foamy macrophages in response 
      to Leptospira challenge. Deer mice exhibit differences in response to different 
      serovars, clinical disease severity, kidney and liver lesions, and an overall sex 
      effect, with male mice demonstrating more severe clinical signs and higher 
      bacterial burden.

AB  - Clostridial diseases significantly threaten livestock health, particularly in 
      cattle, underscoring the need for effective vaccination strategies. This study 
      develops and optimizes a microfluidic-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 
      (ELISA) for the rapid (< 1 h) and cost-effective measurement of IgG antibody 
      levels against various clostridial toxins in cattle vaccinated with a multivalent 
      clostridial vaccine. This assay requires only 5 muL of sample and reagent volume, 
      demonstrating high repeatability and reproducibility with coefficient of 
      variation (CV) values ranging from 0.1 % to 8.5 % across all tested clostridial 
      antigens. The Limit of Detection (LOD) of the assay ranged from 1:150 to 1:800, 
      allowing for sensitive detection of antibody levels. For Clostridium perfringens 
      epsilon toxin, antibody titers were measured using a commercial kit, while microfluidic 
      ELISA was applied to assess titers against tetanus toxoid, Clostridium septicum alpha 
      toxin, Clostridium novyi type B toxins, and Clostridium sordellii toxins. 
      Significant increases in IgG antibody levels were observed for C. perfringens epsilon 
      toxin and tetanus toxoid following both primary and booster vaccine doses, 
      peaking by day 42. Antibody titers against C. septicum alpha toxins and C. novyi type 
      B toxins increased after the primary dose, peaking at day 42, while no booster 
      effect was seen for C. sordellii. These findings highlight the utility of 
      microfluidic ELISAs as a practical and efficient tool for assessing humoral 
      immune responses to clostridial toxins in vaccinated cattle, with potential 
      application for the herd level disease surveillance and vaccine efficacy

AB  - To overcome gastric acid degradation and ensure robust immune activation, a novel 
      Pickering emulsion stabilized by poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) 
      nanoparticles was developed for the co-delivery of vaccine antigens and adjuvants 
      via the oral route. Pickering emulsions, stabilized by solid particles, can 
      enhance stability and protect antigens from gastric degradation. We encapsulated 
      a TLR7/8 agonist R848 in PLGA nanoparticles and fabricated Pickering emulsions 
      (R848-PLGA-NP@PE) to boost immune activation, and further prepared model antigen 
      Ovalbumin (OVA) loaded Pickering emulsion formulation (R848-PLGA-NP@PE-OVA) to 
      induce antigen-specific immune responses. R848-PLGA-NPs can improve vaccine 
      efficacy by serving both as a stabilizer and an adjuvant, activating 
      antigen-presenting cells (APCs). R848-PLGA-NP@PE-OVA exhibited a uniform particle 
      size (245 nm), stable zeta potential (-40 mV), and high antigen encapsulation 
      efficiency (>80 %), that were tested in Simulated Intestinal Fluid (SIF) and 
      Simulated Gastric Fluid (SGF). R848-PLGA-NP@PE exhibited enhanced uptake by and 
      activation of dendritic cells compared to control groups. In vivo, 
      R848-PLGA-NP@PE significantly improved CD4 + T cell, CD8 + T cell, and NK cell 
      activation. Notably, granzyme B expression in NK cells reached 2.1 times the 
      level of the PBS group and 1.45 times that of the Free OVA + R848 group. The 
      OVA-specific IgG level in the R848-PLGA-NP@PE-OVA group was approximately 3.9 
      times that of the PBS group and 2.5 times that of the free R848 + OVA group. 
      Fecal OVA-specific IgA levels were significantly higher than control group. The 
      combined data suggests that Pickering emulsions fabricated with PLGA-NPs are 
      versatile oral vaccine delivery platforms to induce cellular and humoral immune 
      responses.

AB  - The COVID-19 pandemic, caused by SARS-CoV-2, has led to millions of 
      hospitalizations and deaths worldwide. The rapid emergence of new SARS-CoV-2 
      variants significantly challenged the efficacy of licensed vaccines because of 
      the immune evasion caused by key mutations in the receptor-binding domain (RBD). 
      Whether incorporating these critical evolutionary site(s) into COVID-19 vaccines 
      can enhance the immunogenicity needs to be elucidated. In this study, we 
      developed an mRNA vaccine encoding tandem RBDs from the Delta and BA.4/5 variants 
      (RBD-Dimer) to improve cross-variant coverage. Robust humoral and T-cell 
      responses were induced by the vaccine in mice, leading to effective 
      neutralization against the prototype, Delta, and BA.4/5 variants. However, 
      neutralizing activity against BQ.1 and XBB variants was compromised. 
      Pseudovirus-based mutation screening identified F486S as a crucial site for 
      immune evasion. Incorporating this mutation into RBD-Dimer mRNA vaccine 
      candidates significantly enhanced neutralizing antibody response against the XBB 
      variant, while maintaining T-cell responses, indicating an essential role of 
      F486S in broadening immunogenicity against XBB variants. These findings 
      identified the Spike 486 site as a critical immune evasion site and a key 
      determinant for the efficacy of COVID-19 vaccines against emerged variants, and 
      underscored the importance of key sites in RBD in enhancing the breadth of immune 
      protection of COVID-19 vaccines.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: SARS-CoV-2 continues to evolve, population immunity changes, and 
      COVID-19 vaccine formulas have been updated, necessitating ongoing COVID-19 
      vaccine effectiveness (VE) monitoring. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the VE of 
      2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccines against COVID-19-associated emergency department (ED) 
      and urgent care (UC) encounters, hospitalizations, and critical illness, 
      including during XBB- and JN.1-predominant periods. DESIGN, SETTING, AND 
      PARTICIPANTS: This test-negative design VE case-control study was conducted using 
      data from September 21, 2023, to August 22, 2024, from EDs, UC centers, and 
      hospitals in 6 US health care systems. Eligible adults 18 years or older with 
      COVID-19-like illness and molecular or antigen testing for SARS-CoV-2 were 
      studied. Case patients were those with a positive molecular or antigen test 
      result; control patients were those with a negative molecular test result. 
      EXPOSURE: Receipt of 2023-2024 (monovalent XBB.1.5) COVID-19 vaccination with 
      products approved or authorized for use in the US. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: 
      Main outcomes were COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters, hospitalizations, 
      and critical illness (admission to the intensive care unit or in-hospital death). 
      VE was estimated comparing the odds of receipt of the 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccine 
      with no receipt among case and control patients. RESULTS: Among 345 639 eligible 
      ED and UC encounters in immunocompetent adults 18 years or older with 
      COVID-19-like illness and available test results (median [IQR] age, 53 [34-71] 
      years; 209 087 [60%] female), 37 096 (11%) had a positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. 
      VE against COVID-19-associated ED and UC encounters was 24% (95% CI, 21%-26%) 
      during 7 to 299 days after vaccination. Among 111 931 eligible hospitalizations 
      in immunocompetent adults 18 years or older with COVID-19-like illness and 
      available test results (median [IQR] age, 71 [58-81] years), 10 380 (9%) had a 
      positive SARS-CoV-2 test result. During 7 to 299 days after vaccination, VE was 
      29% (95% CI, 25%-33%) against COVID-19-associated hospitalization and 48% (95% 
      CI, 40%-55%) against COVID-19-associated critical illness. VE was highest 7 to 59 
      days after vaccination (VE against ED and UC encounters 49%; 95% CI, 46%-52%; 
      hospitalization, 51%; 95% CI, 46%-56%; critical illness, 68%; 95% CI, 56%-76%) 
      and then waned (VE 180-299 days after vaccination against ED and UC encounters, 
      -7% [95% CI, -13% to -2%]; hospitalization, -4% [95% CI, -14% to 5%]; and 
      critical illness, 16% [95% CI, -6 to 34%]). CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this 
      case-control study of VE, 2023-2024 COVID-19 vaccines were estimated to provide 
      additional effectiveness against medically attended COVID-19, with the highest 
      and most sustained estimates against critical illness. These results highlight 
      the importance of receiving recommended COVID-19 vaccination for adults 18 years 
      or older.

TI  - Mycotoxins in Broiler Production: Impacts on Growth, Immunity, Vaccine Efficacy, 
      and Food Safety.
LID - 10.3390/toxins17060261 [doi]
LID - 261
AB  - Mycotoxins are secondary fungal metabolites that frequently contaminate poultry 
      feed, posing significant risks to animal health, productivity, and food safety. 
      In broiler production, mycotoxins such as aflatoxins, trichothecenes, fumonisins, 
      ochratoxin A, deoxynivalenol, and zearalenone have been shown to impair growth 
      performance, damage key organs, and disrupt immune function. This review explores 
      the multifaceted impact of mycotoxin exposure in broilers, with particular 
      emphasis on immunosuppression, decreased vaccine efficacy, and increased 
      vulnerability to infectious diseases, including coccidiosis, salmonellosis, E. 
      coli, and viral infections like infectious bursal disease and infectious 
      laryngotracheitis. Mycotoxin contamination in poultry feed can lead to direct 
      economic losses through reduced feed conversion efficiency, increased mortality, 
      and reproductive disorders, while also resulting in the transfer of toxic 
      residues into meat and eggs, thereby threatening consumer health. The review 
      further examines the synergistic interactions between mycotoxins and pathogens, 
      the physiological and histopathological changes in exposed birds, and the 
      implications for public health. Finally, it discusses current mitigation 
      strategies, including mycotoxin binders, probiotics, and regulatory approaches to 
      reduce exposure. An integrated management strategy combining feed hygiene, 
      monitoring, and targeted nutritional interventions is essential to safeguard 
      poultry health, enhance vaccine responses, and ensure the safety of 
      poultry-derived food products. This review offers actionable insights for 
      veterinarians, nutritionists, and policymakers, reinforcing the importance of 
      mycotoxin mitigation strategies within a One Health framework.

TI  - Self-assembled Ac-FFA-NH(2) based hydrogels with strong immunostimulating 
      activity for vaccine delivery.
LID - 10.1039/d5na00033e [doi]
AB  - Recent research has demonstrated that peptide self-assemblies are effective as 
      vaccine adjuvants, playing a critical role in enhancing vaccine efficacy. In our 
      prior studies, the Ac-FFA-NH(2) peptide gelator was identified as a biocompatible 
      material suitable for tissue engineering applications. In this study, we reveal 
      that the self-assembled Ac-FFA-NH(2) hydrogel functions as a potent vaccine 
      delivery system, as evidenced by its strong immunostimulatory activity in vivo. 
      Mice vaccinated with OVA antigen incorporated into the hydrogel produced 
      significantly higher IgG titers compared to both the unadjuvanted control group 
      and those treated with traditional adjuvants. This suggests that the Ac-FFA-NH(2) 
      hydrogel effectively induces a robust humoral immune response. Moreover, the 
      hydrogel not only enhances humoral immunity but also stimulates a cellular immune 
      response, as indicated by the production of the IgG2a subtype, further 
      establishing it as an excellent vaccine delivery platform. Additionally, we 
      describe a composite hydrogel developed through the stepwise self-assembly of the 
      Ac-FFA-NH(2) peptide and liposomes. Structural characterization using TEM, DSC, 
      and FTIR confirmed that both peptide nanofibers and lipid vesicles retain their 
      structural integrity within the composite gel. Importantly, morphological 
      analysis demonstrated that the mechanical robustness of the hydrogel remains 
      largely unaffected by the presence of liposomes at lipid concentrations lower 
      than the Ac-FFA-NH(2) concentration.

AB  - Rapid and inexpensive quantification of antibody neutralizing efficiency is 
      currently limited due to the use of live virus and strict biosafety level 
      requirements necessary to perform a plaque reduction neutralization test (PRNT), 
      severely restricting efficient evaluation of vaccine efficacy, establishment of 
      correlates of protection, and determination of individual immune status for many 
      viral diseases. Based on the surrogate virus neutralization test (sVNT), we 
      demonstrate a magnetic bead-based electrochemical sVNT (esVNT) for sensitive 
      quantification of SARS-CoV-2 antibody neutralization efficiency in under 15 min 
      using a portable potentiostat. By utilizing magnetic beads as a solid phase for 
      the capture probe and chronoamperometric detection, we show increased capture 
      efficiency of reagents, minimal washing steps, and rapid signal generation 
      without sacrificing sensitivity. The esVNT yields accurate quantification of 
      neutralization efficiency for both monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, even in 
      the presence of potential interferents, as verified by comparison to sVNT. Spiked 
      control serum and serum samples from a biorepository were evaluated, showing 
      minimal matrix effects and the expected neutralization efficiency trends versus 
      disease severity for esVNT compared to PRNT. Trends in PRNT and esVNT responses 
      resulting from clonality, affinity, and neutralization mechanisms are also 
      examined.

AB  - Vaccination is always the most effective approach to control and prevent 
      monkeypox epidemics. The efficacy testing of vaccines is an important component 
      of vaccine quality control. Based on the 3Rs principles, measuring the content of 
      effective proteins in vaccines to evaluate vaccine efficacy is an excellent 
      alternative to traditional in vivo assays. In this study, we reported two 
      indirect competitive ELISA (IC-ELISA) methods based on the use of M1- and 
      A35-specific antibodies that recognize the L1 and A33 proteins of the modified 
      vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) vaccine, which are cross-immunogenic to monkeypox 
      virus (MPXV), respectively. M1-IC-ELISA was shown to be linear over the range of 
      31.25-2000 ng/mL with an LOD value of 48.36 ng/mL. A35-IC-ELISA was shown to be 
      linear over the range of 3.90-1000 ng/mL with an LOD value of 3.74 ng/mL. These 
      two methods were found to be specific, precise, accurate and robust in the 
      quantification of cross-immunogenic L1 and A33 in final MVA vaccine and showed a 
      strong correlation with viral titer, MPXV cross-antibody titer and MVA 
      neutralizing antibody titer. The developed methods may be an alternative to the 
      in vivo assay in quality control testing of MVA vaccine.

AB  - Aquaculture is a central commercial commodity for low-to middle-income countries 
      and a promising source of economically important food and livelihood. Indian 
      aquaculture faces challenges with the onset of several upcoming fish diseases. 
      The antimicrobial resistance (AMR) pathogen Edwardsiella tarda infection is one 
      of the serious threats affecting worldwide aquaculture. Replacing antibiotics, 
      vaccines can be used as a safe treatment for multidrug-resistant E. tarda. The 
      present study focuses on creating a formalin killed vaccine incorporated with 
      IFN-gamma and beta-glucan as adjuvants, that confers protection against E. tarda 
      infection in Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). The isolated virulent strain 
      was cultivated in marine nutrient broth and inactivated by 0.5 % formalin 
      treatment. To increase the immunogenicity, the bacterial suspension was mixed 
      with IFN-gamma and beta-glucan. Fish were intraperitoneally immunized with IFN-gamma and 
      beta-glucan -adjuvanted formalin killed vaccine (FKV), followed by sampling at a 
      fixed time. After 28 days from the first immunization, the fish were challenged 
      with E. tarda at a dose of 1 x 10(7) CFU/fish. Blood from the immunized fish was 
      sampled weekly to measure immunochemical parameters, including sodium oxide 
      dismutase (SOD), myeloperoxidase (MPO), lysozyme activity (LZM), and bactericidal 
      activity. Fish serum IgM titre values were measured on the 14th and 28 day 
      post-vaccination (d.p.v.), and both showed that the adjuvanted vaccinated groups 
      had higher antibody levels than the control group. The vaccinated groups with 
      IFN-gamma and beta-glucan showed considerably higher expressions immune genes, including 
      IgM, TCR beta, MHC II. The study emphasizes that beta-glucan and IFN-gamma adjuvanted 
      inactivated vaccine is a potentially plausible approach toward novel vaccination 
      strategies for sustainable aquaculture.

TI  - Role of Pneumococcal Vaccination as a Preventative Measure for At-risk and 
      High-risk Adults: An Indian Narrative.
PG  - 45-54
LID - 10.59556/japi.73.0989 [doi]
AB  - Pneumococcal disease (PD) remains a significant public health concern, 
      particularly in adults aged >50 years and individuals with comorbidities. India 
      bears approximately 23% of the global burden of community-acquired pneumonia 
      (CAP). The highest rates of morbidity and mortality are linked to Streptococcus 
      pneumoniae-related invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) in adults aged >50 years. 
      Despite the availability of effective vaccines, including the 13-valent 
      pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV13) and the 23-valent pneumococcal 
      polysaccharide vaccine (PPSV23), adult vaccination coverage in India remains 
      suboptimal. A key barrier to adult vaccination is the lack of awareness, with 
      over 80% of adults being unaware of the vaccines available for them. Many people 
      still believe that vaccines are only for children, highlighting the need for 
      better awareness among patients and healthcare providers. Additionally, the 
      absence of dedicated adult vaccination centres limits access, making it crucial 
      to establish such centres and involve trained personnel such as doctors, nurses, 
      and pharmacists in raising awareness. Often, healthcare professionals (HCPs) do 
      not consider underlying comorbidities as risk factors for the development of 
      pneumococcal disease. Additionally, the evidence on vaccine efficacy is 
      scattered. Given these challenges, there is a critical need for a comprehensive 
      review synthesizing the available evidence on pneumococcal vaccination in 
      high-risk and at-risk populations. This review aims to consolidate the most 
      recent findings on the effectiveness of pneumococcal vaccination practices, 
      highlighting the importance of adhering to vaccination guidelines to reduce the 
      public health burden of PD.

TI  - Safety and Efficacy of Repurposed Smallpox Vaccines Against Mpox: A Critical 
      Review of ACAM2000, JYNNEOS, and LC16.
PG  - 88

AB  - Since 2022, outbreaks of monkeypox (Mpox), which is caused by the monkeypox virus 
      (MPXV), have been documented in more than 116 nations, making it a serious danger 
      to world health. Despite being self-limiting in most cases, Mpox can lead to 
      severe illness and even death, especially among high-risk populations like the 
      LGBTQI + community. Hence, there is an urgent need for effective prevention and 
      treatment strategies, with vaccination playing a crucial role. This paper 
      explores the safety and efficacy of three key vaccines; ACAM2000, JYNNEOS, and 
      LC16 that are repurposed from smallpox vaccines to combat Mpox. ACAM2000, a 
      replication-competent vaccinia virus vaccine, has shown high effectiveness but is 
      associated with serious adverse reactions, including myocarditis and progressive 
      vaccinia. JYNNEOS, a modified vaccinia Ankara vaccine, offers a more favorable 
      safety profile with fewer severe side effects, demonstrating 82% vaccine 
      effectiveness in preventing Mpox. LC16, another smallpox vaccine, shows strong 
      protective efficacy in animal models and excellent safety outcomes in human 
      trials. Our assessment of the available primary data suggests that amongst the 
      three candidates, JYNNEOS emerges as the most promising candidate for widespread 
      use due to its strong effectiveness and superior safety profile. However, while 
      Mpox vaccines provide robust protection, their varying safety profiles highlight 
      the need for tailored vaccination strategies based on individual health factors. 
      The authors therefore emphasize balancing vaccine efficacy with safety risks, 
      particularly in vulnerable populations. Further research and surveillance are 
      essential to optimize vaccination strategies and control Mpox outbreaks 
      worldwide.

AB  - Messenger RNA (mRNA) vaccines represent a critical avenue for coronavirus disease 
      2019 (COVID-19) prevention. We developed a COVID-19 mRNA vaccine encoding a 
      codon-optimized full-length ancestral spike (S) protein with a signal peptide, 
      which employs our novel patented co-transcriptional 5'-capping reagent, 
      SmartCap((R)). From the screening capping library of SmartCap((R)), an SC101 cap was 
      selected to derive a novel mRNA vaccine, STP2104. An in vitro study of STP2104 
      incorporating SC101 revealed enhanced protein expression in both the cell lysate 
      and culture medium, and an in vivo immunogenicity study revealed strong humoral 
      and cell-mediated immune responses. STP2104 further displayed potent neutralizing 
      activity in immunized mice as derived via the PRNT(50) assay using the wild-type 
      virus. We evaluated the protection efficacy of STP2104 using human ACE2 
      transgenic mice immunized and challenged with SARS-CoV-2 to acquire the survival 
      rate, virus titration, and histopathology study data. These studies proved that 
      STP2104 is potent enough to induce protective immunity. A novel capping library 
      screening (CLS) method was successfully utilized for exploring the optimal 5'-cap 
      reagent, which improves S gene expression with mRNA stability. The clinical phase 
      1 studies of STP2104 will prove its safety, tolerability, and immunogenicity as 
      well as the safety of the novel 5'-cap analogue SC101 in humans.

TI  - Single-cell and spatial analyses of the GDF family in tumors, with a focus on the 
      prognostic and biological role of GDF15 in hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - 92

AB  - Growth differentiation factors (GDFs) are a subfamily of the TGF-beta superfamily 
      whose expression increases in response to cellular stress and disease. Despite 
      emerging cell- or animal-based evidence supporting an association between the GDF 
      subfamily and cancer, systematic pan-cancer analyses of the GDF subfamily based 
      on single-cell and spatial transcriptomes remains unavailable. In this study, we 
      performed a comprehensive analysis of the GDF subfamily in 33 cancers, including 
      expression, diagnosis, methylation, prognostic value, immune infiltration 
      analysis, and potential biological pathways. We focused on the analysis of 
      multi-group scRNA-seq and spatial data in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) to 
      determine the role of the GDF family in the tumor microenvironment and its 
      applicability in immunotherapy. Moreover, both the gain and loss of function 
      strategies were used to assess the function of Growth differentiation factor 15 
      (GDF15) in cell lines of HCC. The GDF subfamily is expressed to varying degrees 
      in most tumors and is significantly correlated with the prognosis of cancer 
      patients. Subsequent scRNA-seq analysis depicted the heterogeneous cellular 
      ecosystems of normal liver and HCC. Hepatocytes expressing GDF15 were less 
      differentiated in HCC, and GDF15 promoted proliferation and invasion of HCC cell 
      lines. Compared to normal liver, the strength of crosstalk between GDF15-positive 
      Hepatocytes and other cells was enhanced in tumors, especially cancer-associated 
      fibroblasts (CAFs)-derived Periostin and GDF15-positive Hepatocytes both regulate 
      each other and jointly promote hepatocarcinogenesis. Further spatial 
      transcriptomic data showed that GDF15 expression was negatively correlated with 
      immune infiltration, especially in M1-type macrophages. Notably, validation 
      analyses in bulk RNA-seq consistently emphasized the clinical significance of 
      these findings. This study provides a comprehensive overview of the oncogenic 
      role of the GDF subfamily in a wide range of tumors, highlights the important 
      role of GDF15 in HCC ecosystem, and provides important biomarkers and potential 
      therapeutic targets for future research.

AB  - Lyophilized drugs and biologics have an outsized role in protecting public health 
      due to their ability to provide extended shelf life for stockpiling. Over 70% (14 
      out of 19) of antibiotics on the Essential Medicines list are supplied as 
      lyophilized sterile powders for injection (FDA, 1). Additionally, many new drugs, 
      including first-in-kind medicines, such as the first checkpoint inhibitor cancer 
      immunotherapy Keytruda, were initially introduced to market in a lyophilized 
      form, accelerating availability to patients by several years while a stable 
      liquid formulation was being developed. The article describes methodologies, both 
      short-term and long-term, to address the current manufacturing challenges for 
      lyophilized injectables based on the findings of the workshop by National 
      Institute of Pharmaceutical Technology and Education held in January 2024.

TI  - Co-delivery of Exemestane and Genistein via Chitosan Coated Liposomes for 
      Enhanced Antitumor Effect and Bone Loss Prevention in Breast Cancer Therapy: In 
      Vivo Evaluation.
PG  - 174
LID - 10.1208/s12249-025-03163-y [doi]
AB  - Breast cancer (BC) is the most prevalent form of cancer among women worldwide, 
      accounting for approximately 36% of cancer cases. Due to its inimitable 
      pathological expression and restricted success of accessible therapeutic 
      modalities, fanatical research in this area is essential. Our group has developed 
      a nanovesicular lipid carrier system consisting of Exemestane (EXM) and Genistein 
      (GNS), which have been successfully incorporated into both uncoated and 
      chitosan-coated liposomes. This combination aims to enhance anticancer efficacy. 
      EXM is known to cause bone loss, while GNS, a natural isoflavone, has been shown 
      in research to possess bone-protective effects. Therefore, we combined these two 
      compounds to mitigate the side effects of EXM. Our previous publication details 
      the formulation development of uncoated EXM-GNS liposomes (EXM-GNS-LPS) and 
      chitosan-coated EXM-GNS liposomes (CH-EXM-GNS-LPS), where we addressed the 
      pharmacotechnical challenges of combining a synthetic drug with herbal drug. Both 
      uncoated and coated liposomes were tested for their budding effects on bone loss 
      induced by hormonal therapy. Pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic studies were 
      conducted on rat models with breast cancer, treated with different formulations. 
      Biochemical investigations revealed significant changes in biomarker levels, 
      indicating effects on bone development and resorption. Improvements in bone 
      health and anticancer efficacy were observed to be statistically significant 
      (p < 0.05). Micro-CT analysis of bone samples showed that the chitosan-coated 
      EXM-GNS liposome treatment group yielded the best results when evaluate against 
      other treatment groups. Additionally, histological examination of the bone 
      treated with CH-EXM-GNS-LPS demonstrated a marked restoration of trabecular bone 
      architecture, characterized by a well-connected bone matrix and narrower 
      inter-trabecular spaces compared to the toxic control group. The synergistic 
      effect of EXM and GNS, encapsulated in liposomes, offers an innovative solution 
      to the challenges of breast cancer treatment. The chitosan coating not only 
      improved the stability and controlled release of the drugs but also provided 
      additional benefits in terms of biocompatibility and targeting potential. 
      Overall, the results of this study indicate that the CH-EXM-GNS-LPS formulation 
      holds significant promise as a therapeutic and preventive strategy for bone loss 
      associated with hormonal therapy in breast cancer patients. This work lays the 
      foundation for future clinical applications, highlighting the potential for 
      combining synthetic and natural compounds in advanced drug delivery systems to 
      address complex, multifactorial health issues.

TI  - Tumour-associated vasculature in T cell homing and immunity: opportunities for 
      cancer therapy.
LID - 10.1038/s41577-025-01187-w [doi]
AB  - The formation of new blood vessels - known as angiogenesis - is essential for the 
      growth and spread of solid tumours. It is promoted by the hypoxic conditions that 
      develop in growing tumours and drive the expression of pro-angiogenic growth 
      factors by tumour cells and various stromal cells. However, the tumour-associated 
      vasculature (TAV) generated by angiogenesis is abnormal and is a key barrier to T 
      cell entry into tumours. Moreover, the TAV creates a hostile microenvironment 
      owing to an accumulation of suppressive immune cells, hypoxic and acidic 
      conditions, and high interstitial pressure, which all limit the function and 
      survival of effector T cells. Here, we present the mechanisms of T cell migration 
      into tumours, including via high endothelial venules, and the importance of 
      tertiary lymphoid structures, which function as privileged sites for antigen 
      presentation, activation and co-stimulation of T cells, for mounting effective 
      antitumour immunity. We describe how the tumour vasculature limits antitumour T 
      cell responses and how T cell responses could be improved by therapeutic 
      targeting of the TAV. In particular, the use of combination therapies that aim to 
      normalize tumour blood vessels, favourably reprogramme endogenous immunity, and 
      support T cell trafficking, function and persistence will be key to improving

LID - 10.1111/ijd.17842 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately 50% of patients with advanced melanoma treated with 
      first-line anti-PD-1 immunotherapy achieve clinical benefit. However, to date, 
      there are no validated biomarkers for objective response (ORR), progression-free 
      survival (PFS), or overall survival (OS) with this treatment. METHODS: We 
      performed a unicentric retrospective analysis of ORR, PFS, and OS in 138 patients 
      with advanced melanoma treated with first-line anti-PD-1 monoclonal antibodies. 
      Baseline blood parameters were analyzed as potential predictive or prognostic 
      biomarkers. ORR was assessed using both RECIST (Response Evaluation Criteria In 
      Solid Tumors) v.1.1 and iRECIST (Immune Response Evaluation Criteria In Solid 
      Tumors). Survival analysis was performed using Kaplan-Meier curves, and 
      comparisons were made using the log-rank test. Multivariate Cox regression 
      analysis was used to determine independent prognostic factors for survival, and a 
      logistic regression model was used for response. RESULTS: The median follow-up 
      was 44.1 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 40.4-49.4) months. Elevated pretreatment 
      lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level and systemic immune-inflammation index (SII) 
      were negative prognostic factors for PFS. However, only LDH remained 
      statistically significant on multivariate analysis [hazard ratio (HR) 1.72, 95% 
      CI: 1.09-2.70, p = 0.019, HR 1.69, 95% CI: 0.95-3.00, p = 0.072]. Increased 
      pretreatment LDH level and SII were both negative prognostic factors for OS on 
      multivariate analysis (HR 2.25, 95% CI: 1.35-3.75, p = 0.002, HR 2.37, 95% CI: 
      1.29-4.37, p = 0.006). CONCLUSIONS: Elevated pretreatment levels of SII and LDH 
      were shown to be independent negative prognostic factors for OS. According to the 
      nomogram for OS, which considers a combination of pretreatment parameters 
      including LDH and SII, it is possible to predict 24-month OS in the first line of 
      anti-PD-1 therapy.

AB  - Ferroptosis, an iron-dependent cell death driven by lipid peroxidation, has 
      emerged as a pivotal mechanism in cancer biology with significant therapeutic 
      potential. Immune cells, both innate and adaptive, are integral in detecting and 
      eliminating tumor cells, yet their response is intricately modulated by 
      ferroptosis. While cancer cell ferroptosis stimulates anti-tumor immunity, 
      ferroptosis in immune cells undermines their effectiveness, compromising overall 
      immune surveillance. The intricate crosstalk between ferroptosis and immune 
      responses is pivotal in tumor progression and therapeutic outcomes, shaping both 
      cancer resistance and treatment effectiveness. This review explores the 
      multifaceted relationship between ferroptosis and immune function in cancer, 
      offering insights into how these processes intersect to shape tumor immunity and 
      guide immunotherapy strategies. We highlight cutting-edge research, uncover key 
      molecular mechanisms, and outline promising avenues for future studies and 
      therapeutic interventions in this evolving field.

TI  - Radium-223 in Men with Metastatic Castration-resistant Prostate Cancer: A 
      Systematic Literature Review of Real-world Outcomes in Observational Studies.
LID - S2588-9311(25)00172-5 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.euo.2025.06.002 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Radium-223 (Ra-223) has been approved since 2013 for 
      men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) with bone 
      metastases. Since then, the treatment landscape has changed dramatically, and a 
      comprehensive understanding of the real-world outcomes of Ra-223 use is needed. 
      This systematic literature review summarizes the real-world effectiveness and 
      safety of Ra-223 in men with mCRPC. METHODS: Electronic databases were searched 
      systematically for real-world observational studies from the past 10 yr examining 
      the outcomes in men with mCRPC treated with Ra-223. KEY FINDINGS AND LIMITATIONS: 
      Forty-eight studies including 15 368 men with mCRPC met the inclusion criteria. 
      Most studies were from Europe (n = 22) and North America (n = 18; sample size 
      range, 104-1628). Studies in Europe and North America reported >/=60% and 55% 
      completing five or more cycles of Ra-223, respectively. First-line therapy, no 
      prior chemotherapy or immunotherapy, and high hemoglobin and neutrophil levels 
      were the key factors associated with completing five or more cycles. The median 
      real-world overall survival varied (11-24 mo), with one exception. Completion of 
      five or more cycles was associated with a two- to five-fold increase in the 
      median real-world overall survival. Of 14 studies reporting fractures, incidence 
      was <10% in most studies (n = 12), with trends toward lower rates using bone 
      health agents (BHAs). CONCLUSIONS AND CLINICAL IMPLICATIONS: This is the most 
      comprehensive review of the effectiveness and safety of the use of Ra-223 in a 
      population after the adoption of androgen-receptor pathway inhibitors. The 
      findings highlight the survival benefits of the early use of Ra-223 with 
      completion of five or more cycles, a favorable safety profile, and low rates of 
      fracture when guideline-recommended BHAs are used.

AB  - There is an unmet medical need for the treatment of elderly patients with acute 
      lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), as only a minority of them achieves long-term 
      survival with current anti-ALL chemotherapy. Here, the recent management of these 
      patients is discussed, including current approaches and future directions, as 
      novel agents developed for refractory/relapsed ALL are now being incorporated 
      into front-line therapies with very promising results. The manuscript will 
      sequentially consider Philadelphia chromosome (Ph) negative ALL, then Ph+ and 
      finally T-ALL. Accordingly, novel strategies using chemo-free approaches and new 
      drugs such as inotuzumab ozogamicin, blinatumomab, venetoclax, tyrosine kinase 
      inhibitors and CAR T-cells will be discussed.

AB  - Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT) is a life-saving procedure to 
      treat hematopoietic disorders. Current bone marrow conditioning protocols create 
      space for healthy donor stem cells by employing irradiation and/or chemotherapy, 
      but carry severe toxicities, resulting in significant morbidity, mortality and 
      substantial long-term complications. To develop a low-toxicity solution, we 
      generated a bi-specific T-cell engager (BTCE) that targets CD117, an abundantly 
      expressed receptor on hematopoietic stem and progenitor cells (HSPC) and 
      leukemia-initiating cells (LICs). We show that the CD117xCD3 BTCE efficiently 
      depletes in vitro and in vivo HSPCs and LICs. The CD117xCD3 BTCE was not toxic 
      and facilitates highly efficient engraftment of human allogenic donor CD34+cells 
      in humanized mice, thereby restoring hematopoiesis in vivo in both normal and 
      leukemia-bearing humanized mice. We demonstrate here that a potent CD117xCD3 BTCE 
      enables rapid HSCT in both benign and malignant conditions.

AB  - N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor encephalitis is a rare autoimmune 
      encephalitis characterised by high morbidity and mortality, often necessitating 
      intensive care. We report the case of a woman in her early 20s who presented with 
      fever, altered sensorium, dyskinesia, keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia. 
      A diagnosis of NMDA receptor encephalitis combined with Sjogren's syndrome (SS) 
      was established based on her history, clinical findings, biochemical analysis and 
      radiological imaging. The condition was successfully managed with immunotherapy 
      and other supportive treatments. This rare combination of NMDA receptor 
      encephalitis and SS presents overlapping central nervous system manifestations, 
      posing a diagnostic challenge.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the characteristics of immune cell infiltration in 
      tumor samples from Chinese patients with clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) 
      and the correlation of immune cell infiltration with tumor stage and response to 
      immunotherapy. METHODS: Tumor samples and clinicopathological data were collected 
      from 154 ccRCC patients treated in Nanfang Hospital, Southern Medical University 
      from October, 2020 to October, 2023. The immune cell types infiltrating the tumor 
      tissues were identified using immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence 
      staining, and their correlations with the patients' clinicopathological 
      characteristics were analyzed. Patient-derived tumor tissue fragment models 
      (PDTF) models, constructed using tumor tissues from 22 patients, were treated 
      with PD-1 monoclonal antibody, and T cell activation was detected using flow 
      cytometry to assess the patients' responses to immunotherapy. RESULTS: In Chinese 
      ccRCC patients included in this study, CD8(+) T cells, CD4(+) T cells, and CD3(+) 
      T cells were the most abundant in the tumor tissues. Higher infiltration levels 
      of CD3(+) T cells (P=0.004), PD-1(+) T cells (P=0.020), CD68(+) T cells 
      (P=0.049), CD79(+) T cells (P=0.049), and Tryptase(+) cells (P=0.049) were all 
      positively correlated with a larger tumor size (>/=5 cm). A higher infiltration 
      level of CD4(+) T cells was associated with a lower tumor stage. Patients with 
      higher International Society of Urological Pathology (ISUP) grades had higher 
      infiltration levels of CD3(+) T cells (P=0.023), CD8(+) T cells (P=0.045), 
      PD-1(+) T cells (P=0.014), CD20(+) B cells (P=0.020) and CD79(+) B cells 
      (P=0.049), and lower levels of Tryptase(+) cells (P=0.001). Patients with 
      abundant infiltrating immune cells tended to have better responses to 
      immunotherapy. CONCLUSIONS: The infiltrating immune cells are heterogeneous in 
      Chinese ccRCC patients, and immune cell infiltration characteristics are closely 
      correlated with clinicopathological parameters of the patients.

PG  - 2259-2266
LID - 10.21873/invivo.14021 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: We have previously reported that patients experiencing oral 
      mucositis (OM) during anthracycline-cyclophosphamide treatment develop symptoms 
      following subsequent docetaxel-containing chemotherapy for perioperative breast 
      cancer therapy. However, the concomitant use of pertuzumab and trastuzumab with 
      docetaxel has also been suggested as a significant risk factor for OM. This study 
      aimed to further evaluate the direct relationship of OM with 
      anthracycline-cyclophosphamide treatment and docetaxel monotherapy. PATIENTS AND 
      METHODS: Patients with breast cancer who underwent anthracycline-cyclophosphamide 
      treatment followed by docetaxel monotherapy as perioperative therapy (n=63) were 
      divided into control and OM-experience groups based on the absence or presence of 
      OM development during prior anthracycline-cyclophosphamide treatment, and 
      retrospectively evaluated. The primary endpoint was the comparison of all-grade 
      OM incidence in the first docetaxel cycle between the two groups. The incidence 
      of OM and dysgeusia was also assessed across all treatment cycles. RESULTS: The 
      incidence of all-grade OM was 42.9% in the OM-experience group and 9.5% in the 
      control group during the first cycle (p=0.006) and 47.6% and 11.9% across all 
      treatment cycles (p=0.004), thereby achieving the primary endpoint. In contrast, 
      the incidence of grade >/=2 OM in both settings was higher in the OM-experience 
      group than in the control group, although the difference was not statistically 
      significant (14.3% vs. 2.4%, p=0.10 for both settings). Moreover, the incidence 
      of dysgeusia did not differ between the two groups. CONCLUSION: Patients 
      exhibiting OM during prior anthracycline-cyclophosphamide treatment were 
      significantly more likely to develop symptoms during subsequent docetaxel 
      monotherapy for perioperative breast cancer therapy.

      Adverse Events.
PG  - 1833-1839
LID - 10.21873/invivo.13983 [doi]
AB  - Immune-related adverse events (irAEs) are excessive immune responses resembling 
      autoimmune diseases, induced by immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs), and can 
      affect organs throughout the body. In contrast to AEs associated with 
      conventional cytotoxic anticancer agents, irAEs may persist or recur after 
      treatment discontinuation. The risk of irAEs recurrence is thought to vary 
      depending on the type and severity of the initial irAE, while the response rate 
      depends on the type and sequence of ICIs re-administered. Therefore, the decision 
      to resume ICI therapy depends on the type and severity of prior irAEs, as well as 
      the anticipated benefits and risks of resumption. This review focuses on the 
      risks and benefits of resuming ICI therapy after each irAE and summarizes the 
      procedure for its resumption.

TI  - ITGAV Regulation of LGALS3BP-JUNB Axis Facilitates the Cell-to-Cell Adhesion and 
      Invasiveness of Hepatic Cancer Cells.
PG  - 2997-3008
LID - 10.21873/anticanres.17665 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: ITGAV is a key regulator of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) 
      progression, that promotes cell adhesion, migration, and TGF-beta1 activation. 
      However, its transcriptional regulation remains poorly understood. This study 
      aimed to elucidate the role of LGALS3BP, a secreted regulator of the TGF-beta1 
      signaling pathway, in ITGAV expression and its functional implications in tumor 
      progression. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Public databases (TCGA HCC, GSE271352, 
      GSE271354) and clinical samples from 83 HCC patients at CNUHH were analyzed to 
      investigate the regulation of ITGAV by LGALS3BP and its downstream 
      transcriptional regulator, JUNB. Molecular analyses, including qRT-PCR, western 
      blotting, and ChIP assays, were conducted to assess ITGAV expression and JunB 
      binding at its promoter sites. Functional studies were performed in hepatic 
      cancer cell lines using recombinant LGALS3BP treatment and siRNA-mediated 
      knockdown experiments to evaluate their effects on ITGAV expression and 
      associated phenotypes. RESULTS: ITGAV expression showed a significant positive 
      correlation with LGALS3BP and JUNB in both TCGA and CNUHH HCC patients. Treatment 
      with recombinant LGALS3BP induced ITGAV expression by enhancing JunB 
      transcriptional activity. Conversely, LGALS3BP knockdown significantly suppressed 
      ITGAV expression, reducing cell-to-cell adhesion and invasiveness in hepatic 
      cancer cells. CONCLUSION: The LGALS3BP-JUNB axis regulates ITGAV expression and 
      contributes to HCC progression. Targeting ITGAV, with LGALS3BP as a potential 
      biomarker, and the combined inhibition of both LGALS3BP and ITGAV may represent a 
      promising therapeutic strategy for HCC.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Despite advances in cancer therapy, the incidence and death rates 
      of patients with colorectal cancer are still high, underscoring the need for new 
      treatment strategies. Damnacanthal, an anthraquinone found in Morinda citrifolia 
      L. (common name noni), is known to induce apoptosis and inhibit cell growth in 
      various types of cancer cells. This study aimed to elucidate the anticancer 
      mechanism of damnacanthal in colorectal cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 
      Damnacanthal was tested on colorectal cancer cell lines (HCT116 and SW480) as 
      well as colorectal cancer spheroids. We evaluated beta-catenin activity by 
      TOP/FOPFlash assay. Western blotting and quantitative polymerase chain reaction 
      were used to measure beta-catenin and T-cell factor 4 (TCF4) expression. RESULTS: We 
      found that damnacanthal reduced the transcriptional activity of beta-catenin, 
      resulting in the down-regulation of its target genes. Additionally, damnacanthal 
      reduced the expression of TCF4, a key protein in the WNT/beta-catenin pathway, in a 
      dose-dependent manner. We also observed a decrease in DNA-bound TCF4 when 
      colorectal cancer cells were treated with damnacanthal. CONCLUSION: Damnacanthal 
      exerts anticancer activity by reducing TCF4 expression in colorectal cancer 
      cells. Our data provide novel insights into the molecular mechanism of 
      damnacanthal in colorectal cancer cells, offering a promising new treatment 
      strategy.

TI  - Immunotherapy and Chemotherapy for Advanced or Recurrent Endometrial Carcinoma.
PG  - 2711-2717
LID - 10.21873/anticanres.17641 [doi]
AB  - Patients with early-stage endometrial cancer are frequently treated with surgery 
      and radiotherapy or chemotherapy, for which 5-year survival rates approach 95%; 
      conversely, the outcomes for patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial 
      cancer are more inauspicious. Fortunately, the advent of immunotherapy, combined 
      with chemotherapy, has conferred improved survival, especially in endometrial 
      cancer patients with a mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR). We conducted an 
      extensive PubMed search on the topics of endometrial cancer and immunotherapy 
      treatment. The combination of dostarlimab and chemotherapy reportedly coincides 
      with a 2-year progression-free survival (PFS) of 61% compared to a 12-month PFS 
      of 74% for pembrolizumab. Moreover, the follow-up data for dostarlimab extended 
      beyond 44 months and the median overall survival (OS) has not been reached 
      compared to more limited OS data for both pembrolizumab and durvalumab; 
      additionally, dostarlimab's pronounced risk of disease progression or death in 
      both dMMR (70%) and mismatch repair-proficient (pMMR) (46%) patients is 
      considerable. While pembrolizumab, dostarlimab and durvalumab with chemotherapy 
      are associated with beneficial outcomes in advanced-stage or recurrent 
      endometrial cancer, dostarlimab has distinguished itself with unsurpassed 
      survival data compared to pembrolizumab and durvalumab.

AB  - Breast cancer (BC) remains the most prevalent malignancy among women worldwide, 
      with incidence and mortality rates varying across regions due to disparities in 
      screening, diagnosis, and treatment accessibility. Molecular classification has 
      redefined BC management, categorizing tumors into luminal A, luminal B, human 
      epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-enriched, and triple-negative breast 
      cancer (TNBC), each with distinct prognostic and therapeutic implications. 
      Advances in tumor microenvironment (TME) research highlight its critical role in 
      cancer progression, immune evasion, and treatment resistance, underscoring the 
      importance of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes, natural killer cells, and 
      macrophages in shaping BC outcomes. Traditional therapies, including 
      chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted treatments such as cyclin-dependent 
      kinase 4 and 6 (CDK4/6) and phosphatidylinositol-4,5-biphosphate 3-kinase (PI3K) 
      inhibitors, continue to evolve to overcome resistance mechanisms. Immunotherapy, 
      particularly immune checkpoint inhibitors targeting programmed cell death protein 
      1 (PD1), programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1), and cytotoxic 
      T-lymphocyte-associated antigen 4 (CTLA4), has demonstrated clinical benefits, 
      especially in TNBC. Additionally, novel strategies, including chimeric antigen 
      receptor T-cell therapy and cancer vaccines, are emerging as promising 
      therapeutic avenues. This review provides a comprehensive analysis of BC 
      epidemiology, molecular subtypes, TME interactions, and cutting-edge therapeutic 
      strategies, emphasizing the need for personalized, immune-based approaches to 
      enhance treatment efficacy and patient outcomes.

TI  - Long-Term Safety Analysis of Pooled Data for Tislelizumab as Monotherapy or in

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tislelizumab, an anti-programmed cell death protein 1 monoclonal 
      antibody, has demonstrated efficacy and safety in solid tumors. This analysis 
      evaluates its long-term safety.Patients and Methods: A retrospective analysis was 
      performed on data from eight randomized phase III clinical trials involving 
      patients with advanced gastrointestinal (GI) or lung cancers who received 
      tislelizumab. Endpoints included immune-mediated adverse events (imAEs) by tumor 
      type, race, and treatment duration, including early (within 1 year) and delayed 
      (>1 year) imAEs. RESULTS: In all, 2636 patients (1415 with GI cancer, 1221 with 
      lung cancer) were included in the analysis, with a median follow-up of 15.4 
      months. Most imAEs were low grade. In GI cancers, 32.5% of patients experienced 
      any-grade imAEs (7.3% grade >/=3). In lung cancers, 39.6% reported any-grade imAEs 
      (8.2% grade >/=3). The most frequently reported imAEs were skin toxicity, 
      hypothyroidism, pneumonitis, and hyperthyroidism. The incidence of imAEs was 
      slightly higher in Asian patients compared with non-Asian patients (34.3% vs 
      26.9% in GI cancer and 35.5% vs 29.7% in lung cancer, respectively), but the 
      incidence of grade >/=3 imAEs remained similar (7.5% vs 6.9% in GI cancer and 6.1% 
      vs 7.2% in lung cancer, respectively). Most imAEs occurred within 6 months of 
      treatment initiation. Delayed imAEs were infrequent and predominantly occurred 
      while patients were still receiving tislelizumab therapy. CONCLUSION: 
      Tislelizumab's safety profile, as monotherapy or combined with chemotherapy, 
      remains consistent with previous reports across tumor types. Delayed imAEs were 
      relatively infrequent, with no new signals identified in this long-term safety 
      analysis.

      to accelerated cell proliferation, enhanced metastatic potential, promotion of 
      epithelial‒mesenchymal transition (EMT), maintenance of stem cell 
      characteristics, facilitation of immune evasion, preservation of angiogenesis, 
      and diminished drug sensitivity. Additionally, the potential clinical utility of 
      aberrant N-glycosylation is examined as a novel biomarker for early diagnosis, 
      prognostic evaluation, and treatment monitoring in lung cancer. The analysis 
      highlights the critical involvement of N-glycosylation in chemotherapy 
      resistance, targeted therapy, and immunotherapy, offering new perspectives for 
      the development of innovative therapeutic strategies. Furthermore, this review 
      highlights promising applications of antibody-enzyme engineering technology in 
      achieving more precise lung cancer treatments, introducing new opportunities for 
      the field. These findings provide a significant theoretical basis and 
      experimental evidence to support progress in lung cancer research and treatment 
      advancements.

AB  - Over the past two decades, immunotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment by 
      shifting our strategies to harness the body's own immune system, with the promise 
      of inhibiting or even eliminating tumors through methods that control and enhance 
      immune responses. Pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), one of the most lethal 
      malignancies, features an immunosuppressive tumor immune microenvironment (TIME) 
      that serves as the core factor contributing to poor prognosis of patients. 
      Emerging research has unveiled the dual role of innate lymphoid cells (ILCs), 
      acting as tissue-resident innate immune hubs, in PDAC immune regulation through 
      their dynamic plasticity, heterogeneity, and interactions with various adaptive 
      immune cells. This review systematically summarizes the latest research 
      advancements in the developmental plasticity of ILC subsets and their 
      bidirectional regulatory network in PDAC, highlighting the potential value of 
      targeting ILCs to reshape the PDAC TIME. Future research should integrate 
      single-cell multi-omics technologies to dissect the spatiotemporal heterogeneity 
      of ILCs, develop strategies to activate their anti-tumor activity, and explore 
      synergistic approaches combining chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)-NK cell therapy 
      with existing immunotherapies, providing new paradigms for transforming PDAC from 
      an immunologically ""cold"" tumor to an immune-sensitive one.

AB  - Recent advances in nanomedicine have paved the way for innovative targeted cancer 
      therapies, particularly through the development of multifunctional nanoscale drug 
      delivery systems. MUC1 aptamer-functionalized chitosan nanoparticles have emerged 
      as a promising platform for the precise delivery of therapeutic agents to 
      MUC1-overexpressing tumors. This review article synthesizes recent studies that 
      employ these engineered nanocarriers to enhance therapeutic efficacy and mitigate 
      multidrug resistance (MDR) in various cancer models. The integration of MUC1 
      aptamers onto chitosan-based nanoparticles significantly improves tumor cell 
      internalization and tumor-specific accumulation, thereby enhancing the 
      cytotoxicity of encapsulated chemotherapeutics such as 5-fluorouracil, SN-38, 
      epirubicin, and docetaxel. Additionally, these systems have been combined with 
      RNA interference agents, photothermal components, and even genome-editing tools 
      to induce synergistic effects, including apoptosis, necroptosis, and 
      immune-mediated cell death. Despite challenges like protein corona formation that 
      can compromise targeting efficiency, the reviewed studies demonstrate notable 
      improvements in drug delivery precision, controlled release under 
      tumor-microenvironment-specific conditions, and effective modulation of MDR 
      mechanisms through suppression of efflux transporters and oncogenic signaling 
      pathways. Collectively, these findings underscore the potential of MUC1 
      aptamer-functionalized chitosan nanoparticles as a highly adaptable and 
      efficacious strategy for synergistic cancer therapy and MDR reversal, with 
      promising implications for future clinical translation.

      phenotype in macrophages cultured on laminin-211/221 isoforms.

AB  - Laminin comprises alpha/beta/gamma subunits and performs tissue-specific functions that 
      control cellular behavior. Laminin-alpha2 chains are highly expressed in neural 
      components such as glial and Schwann cells and in muscles. Macrophages play 
      important roles in tissue homeostasis and repair, and laminins affect macrophage 
      dynamics. Integrin alpha7, a transmembrane receptor crucial for regulating 
      cell-matrix interactions, has a high affinity for laminin-alpha2, but its function in 
      macrophages remains unknown. Here, we find that loss of integrin alpha7 signaling 
      induces a dendritic cell (DC)-like phenotype in THP-1-derived macrophages and in 
      primary monocytes-derived macrophages (MDMs) induced by granulocyte macrophage 
      colony-stimulating factor (GM-CSF) cultured on laminin-alpha2 chains. Functional 
      blocking of integrin alpha7 induced dendritic processes of THP-1-derived macrophages. 
      Gene expression analysis revealed DC markers and costimulatory molecules, and 
      coculture experiments demonstrated that the DC-like cells could stimulate T cell 
      proliferation. Functional inhibition of integrin alpha7 decreased PI3K-p85alpha levels 
      and activated PI3K, thereby activating AKT. MDMs cultured on laminin alpha2 chains 
      decreased integrin alpha7 expression, exhibited dendritic-like morphology, and 
      increased expression of DC markers and costimulatory molecules. These findings 
      suggest that, besides the established influence of cytokine milieu, DC 
      differentiation is regulated by laminin alpha2/integrin alpha7-mediated cell adhesion. 
      Integrin alpha7 has been a therapeutic target in tumors, and antibody-based integrin 
      alpha7 neutralization can be clinically useful. The results of this study suggest 
      implications for integrin alpha7 and laminin-alpha2 chains in DC immunotherapy.

AB  - BACKGROUND: First-line mesothelioma treatment paradigms prioritize histology 
      without integrating molecular features. Findings from other thoracic cancers 
      suggest that tumor immune microenvironment (TME) composition and immunotherapy 
      efficacy are informed by genomic profile. Mesothelioma studies exploring the 
      relationship between molecular alterations, immune infiltrate, and immunotherapy 
      outcomes are needed. METHODS: Exome and transcriptomic sequencing and multiplex 
      immunofluorescence were performed on pleural and peritoneal mesotheliomas 
      annotated for BAP1, CDKN2A, MTAP, and NF2 (merlin) status to infer immune cell 
      abundance and TME composition. Progression-free survival (PFS) and overall 
      survival (OS) on ipilimumab + nivolumab was retrospectively determined according 
      to molecular profile. RESULTS: Transcriptional analysis segregated 113 
      mesothelioma specimens (n=85 epithelioid, n=28 non-epithelioid) into four 
      predefined TME groups: fibrotic (n=14), immune desert (n=52), immune-enriched 
      fibrotic (n=13), and immune-enriched non-fibrotic (n=34). The composition of the 
      immune infiltrate was similar when tumors with BAP1 alterations were compared to 
      BAP1 wildtype tumors. In contrast, specimens with MTAP or CDKN2A loss had global 
      decrease in immune populations with predominance of the immune desert phenotype. 
      There was non-significant increase in T lymphocytes in NF2-altered tumors. 
      Multiplex immunofluorescence similarly demonstrated increased T lymphoid 
      infiltrate in mesotheliomas with merlin loss, including regulatory T cells. On 
      ipilimumab + nivolumab, patients with BAP1 alterations had improved survival 
      whereas those with NF2 and CDKN2A alterations had shorter survival. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Composition of the immune infiltrate may be distinct for mesotheliomas with loss 
      of 9p21 genes (i.e., MTAP, CDKN2A) and NF2 alterations. Overall immune infiltrate 
      abundance did not align with immunotherapy outcomes. Future immunotherapy 
      biomarker development strategies should consider molecular background and 
      functional characterization of mesothelioma tumor-immune interactions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Early detection of cancer therapy-related cardiac dysfunction (CTRCD) 
      after anthracycline exposure is critically important in minimizing morbidity and 
      mortality. Artificial intelligence models applied to electrocardiograms (ECG-AI) 
      may allow for early identification of CTRCD and improved outcomes. METHODS: 
      Patients treated with anthracyclines between 2002 and 2022 across three tertiary 
      centers were evaluated. Characteristics, echocardiograms pre- and 
      post-chemotherapy, and outcomes were reviewed. ECG-AI predictive scores for 
      systolic dysfunction within one year following treatment were collected. ROC 
      analysis was conducted for accuracy of ECG-AI score to detect severe CTRCD (left 
      ventricular ejection fraction <40%). RESULTS: Overall, 3439 patients were 
      included, mean age 60.2 +/- 14.1 years, 53.6% male. Severe CTRCD was present in 114 
      patients. ROC analysis of ECG-AI scores post-initiation of therapy was superior 
      to that of pre-anthracycline ECG-AI scores and had moderate accuracy for 
      detection of severe CTRCD (AUC 0.761). An ECG-AI score >3.0% was independently 
      associated with significantly poorer survival at one year (HR 2.19, 95%CI 
      1.92-2.51) and five years (HR 1.69, 95%CI 1.54-1.87) post-anthracycline therapy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ECG-AI indicating increased likelihood for LVSD post-anthracycline 
      therapy accurately detected severe CTRCD. Clinically, this tool may allow early 
      diagnosis and treatment of high-risk patients and may reduce unnecessary 
      surveillance in those with lower risk.

AB  - Breast cancer remains a major global health concern, necessitating advanced 
      therapeutic strategies to overcome the limitations of conventional systemic 
      treatments. pH-responsive hydrogels have emerged as promising platforms for 
      targeted drug delivery and controlled release, exploiting the acidic 
      microenvironment characteristic of breast tumors. These smart biomaterials can 
      undergo physicochemical changes in response to pH variations, allowing for 
      site-specific release of therapeutic agents. This review explores the unique pH 
      gradients within breast tumor tissues and intracellular compartments, and how 
      they can be harnessed for hydrogel-based drug delivery. We detail the design 
      strategies of pH-sensitive hydrogels, including functional group selection, 
      crosslinking mechanisms, and dual/multi-responsive capabilities. Furthermore, we 
      highlight recent advances in their application for localized chemotherapy, 
      combination therapies, gene/siRNA delivery, and post-surgical implantable 
      systems. Despite their potential, challenges such as tumor heterogeneity and 
      scalability remain. This review also discusses future directions, including 
      personalized hydrogel systems and integration with theranostic tools, paving the 
      way for precision breast cancer therapy.

AB  - Targeted cancer therapy, by leveraging the overexpression of specific molecules 
      on tumors, such as sialic acid (SA), offers a promising strategy to enhance 
      antitumor efficacy while minimizing off-target effects. SA modification of 
      nanomaterials can target both tumor cells and tumor-associated immune cells, 
      improving drug delivery and therapeutic outcomes. Tumor cells with high SA 
      expression bind to sialic acid-binding immunoglobulin-like lectins (Siglecs) and 
      selectins expressed on tumor-associated immune cells, potentially contributing to 
      immunosuppression. By binding to these receptors, SA-modified nanomaterials 
      enhance tumor biodistribution and cellular uptake, improving the efficacy of 
      chemotherapeutics. Additionally, SA-functionalized nanomaterials can target 
      tumor-associated immune cells, such as tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs), 
      allowing for the delivery of chemoimmunotherapeutic agents that can deplete TAMs 
      or reprogram them to an antitumor M1 phenotype. SA-modified nanomaterials can 
      also target peripheral blood monocytes and neutrophils, utilizing them as 
      vehicles for drug delivery to the tumor core. Furthermore, SA-functionalized 
      nanomaterials prove valuable in cancer imaging and theranostics, enhancing the 
      efficacy of imaging agents and theranostic nanomaterials. The multifaceted 
      approach holds significant potential for advancing targeted cancer therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The role of consolidation radiotherapy (cRT) in patients with 
      oligometastatic non-small-cell lung cancer (oligo-NSCLC) without driver genetic 
      alterations remains uncertain in the era of immunotherapy (IO). This study aimed 
      to evaluate the efficacy of cRT combined with IO at various programmed death 
      ligand 1 (PD-L1) expression levels using data from a multicenter cohort. METHODS: 
      Patients with oligo-NSCLC without driver genetic alterations, treated with IO 
      with or without cRT, and with available PD-L1 tumor proportion scores (TPS) were 
      retrospectively reviewed across three institutions. Inverse probability of 
      treatment weighting (IPTW) was applied to control for bias. RESULTS: This study 
      included 240 patients, among which 30.4%, 35.0%, and 34.6% patients had PD-L1 TPS 
      0, 1-49% and >/= 50%, respectively. After IPTW adjustment, subgroup analysis 
      revealed that cRT significantly improved progression-free and overall survival in 
      the PD-L1 TPS 0-49% group (HR: 0.59; 95% CI: 0.38-0.92; P = 0.009; HR: 0.59; 95% 
      CI: 0.35-0.99; P = 0.016; respectively), however, no additional benefit was found 
      in the PD-L1 TPS >/= 50% group. Multivariate Cox analysis identified PD-L1 TPS 
      score as an independent prognostic factor only in the IO group (HR: 0.54; 95% CI: 
      0.34-0.88; P = 0.01). Adding cRT to IO in patients with PD-L1 TPS 0-49% improved 
      survival to levels comparable to those of patients with PD-L1 TPS >/= 50%. 
      Moreover, cRT was associated with lower rate of progression at original sites in 
      the overall cohort (HR: 0.51; 95% CI: 0.32-0.81, P = 0.005), particularly in the 
      PD-L1 TPS 0-49% subgroup (HR: 0.38; 95%: CI 0.21-0.68; P = 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: 
      The addition of cRT to IO may improve survival outcomes for driver-negative 
      oligometastatic NSCLC patients with low or negative PD-L1 expression. The PD-L1 
      TPS may be a valuable biomarker to optimize cRT patient selection in the era of 
      immunotherapy. Further prospective investigations into this stratification 
      strategy are warranted.

      from 1980 to 2023 with forecasts to 2030: a systematic analysis for the Global 
      Burden of Disease Study 2023.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Since its inception in 1974, the Essential Programme on Immunization 
      (EPI) has achieved remarkable success, averting the deaths of an estimated 154 
      million children worldwide through routine childhood vaccination. However, more 
      recent decades have seen persistent coverage inequities and stagnating progress, 
      which have been further amplified by the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, WHO set 
      ambitious goals for improving vaccine coverage globally through the Immunization 
      Agenda 2030 (IA2030). Now halfway through the decade, understanding past and 
      recent coverage trends can help inform and reorient strategies for approaching 
      these aims in the next 5 years. METHODS: Based on the Global Burden of Diseases, 
      Injuries, and Risk Factors Study 2023, this study provides updated global, 
      regional, and national estimates of routine childhood vaccine coverage from 1980 
      to 2023 for 204 countries and territories for 11 vaccine-dose combinations 
      recommended by WHO for all children globally. Employing advanced modelling 
      techniques, this analysis accounts for data biases and heterogeneity and 
      integrates new methodologies to model vaccine scale-up and COVID-19 
      pandemic-related disruptions. To contextualise historic coverage trends and gains 
      still needed to achieve the IA2030 coverage targets, we supplement these results 
      with several secondary analyses: (1) we assess the effect of the COVID-19 
      pandemic on vaccine coverage; (2) we forecast coverage of select life-course 
      vaccines up to 2030; and (3) we analyse progress needed to reduce the number of 
      zero-dose children by half between 2023 and 2030. FINDINGS: Overall, global 
      coverage for the original EPI vaccines against diphtheria, tetanus, and pertussis 
      (first dose [DTP1] and third dose [DTP3]), measles (MCV1), polio (Pol3), and 
      tuberculosis (BCG) nearly doubled from 1980 to 2023. However, this long-term 
      trend masks recent challenges. Coverage gains slowed between 2010 and 2019 in 
      many countries and territories, including declines in 21 of 36 high-income 
      countries and territories for at least one of these vaccine doses (excluding BCG, 
      which has been removed from routine immunisation schedules in some countries and 
      territories). The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated these challenges, with global 
      rates for these vaccines declining sharply since 2020, and still not returning to 
      pre-COVID-19 pandemic levels as of 2023. Coverage for newer vaccines developed 
      and introduced in more recent years, such as immunisations against pneumococcal 
      disease (PCV3) and rotavirus (complete series; RotaC) and a second dose of the 
      measles vaccine (MCV2), saw continued increases globally during the COVID-19 
      pandemic due to ongoing introductions and scale-ups, but at slower rates than 
      expected in the absence of the pandemic. Forecasts to 2030 for DTP3, PCV3, and 
      MCV2 suggest that only DTP3 would reach the IA2030 target of 90% global coverage, 
      and only under an optimistic scenario. The number of zero-dose children, proxied 
      as children younger than 1 year who do not receive DTP1, decreased by 74.9% (95% 
      uncertainty interval 72.1-77.3) globally between 1980 and 2019, with most of 
      those declines reached during the 1980s and the 2000s. After 2019, counts of 
      zero-dose children rose to a COVID 19-era peak of 18.6 million (17.6-20.0) in 
      2021. Most zero-dose children remain concentrated in conflict-affected regions 
      and those with various constraints on resources available to put towards 
      vaccination services, particularly sub-Saharan Africa. As of 2023, more than 50% 
      of the 15.7 million (14.6-17.0) global zero-dose children resided in just eight 
      countries (Nigeria, India, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Somalia, 
      Sudan, Indonesia, and Brazil), emphasising persistent inequities. INTERPRETATION: 
      Our estimates of current vaccine coverage and forecasts to 2030 suggest that 
      achieving IA2030 targets, such as halving zero-dose children compared with 2019 
      levels and reaching 90% global coverage for life-course vaccines DTP3, PCV3, and 
      MCV2, will require accelerated progress. Substantial increases in coverage are 
      necessary in many countries and territories, with those in sub-Saharan Africa and 
      south Asia facing the greatest challenges. Recent declines will need to be 
      reversed to restore previous coverage levels in Latin America and the Caribbean, 
      especially for DTP1, DTP3, and Pol3. These findings underscore the crucial need 
      for targeted, equitable immunisation strategies. Strengthening primary 
      health-care systems, addressing vaccine misinformation and hesitancy, and 
      adapting to local contexts are essential to advancing coverage. COVID-19 pandemic 
      recovery efforts, such as WHO's Big Catch-Up, as well as efforts to bolster 
      routine services must prioritise reaching marginalised populations and target 
      subnational geographies to regain lost ground and achieve global immunisation 
      goals. FUNDING: The Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation and Gavi, the Vaccine

AB  - Although the influence of gut microbiota on various tumors has gained 
      recognition, the intricate mechanisms underlying its effects on brain tumors 
      remain largely unexplored. Our study aims to discover crucial gut microbiota that 
      significantly bolster the immune response against brain tumors. Employing a 
      murine model, we utilize 16S rRNA sequencing to analyze the evolution of gut 
      microbiota alongside tumor progression, and we intervene with dietary adjustments 
      using tryptophan to restore microbiota alterations. Tryptophan supplementation 
      not only reverses these microbial changes but also significantly enhances 
      survival by boosting T cell circulation and improves the efficacy of 
      immunotherapy. Among the microbial species that respond positively to tryptophan, 
      Duncaniella dubosii emerges as a pivotal contributor, replicating tryptophan's 
      immunomodulatory effects. This study underscores the potential of targeting gut 
      microbiota to enhance immunotherapy efficacy, particularly through mechanisms 
      involving T cell modulation.

TI  - Overcoming resistance to immunotherapy by targeting CD38 in human tumor explants.

AB  - CD38, an ecto-enzyme involved in NAD(+) catabolism, is highly expressed in 
      exhausted CD8(+) T cells and has emerged as an attractive target to improve 
      response to immune checkpoint blockade (ICB) by blunting T cell exhaustion. 
      However, the precise role(s) and regulation of CD38 in exhausted T cells and the 
      efficacy of CD38-directed therapeutic strategies in human cancer remain 
      incompletely defined. Here, we show that CD38(+)CD8(+) T cells are induced by 
      chronic TCR activation and type I interferon stimulation and confirm their 
      association with ICB resistance in human melanoma. Disrupting CD38 restores 
      cellular NAD(+) pools and improves T cell bioenergetics and effector functions. 
      Targeting CD38 restores ICB sensitivity in a cohort of patient-derived 
      organotypic tumor spheroids from explanted melanoma specimens. These results 
      support further preclinical and clinical evaluation of CD38-directed therapies in 
      melanoma and underscore the importance of NAD(+) as a vital metabolite to enhance 
      those therapies.

AB  - Cholangiocarcinoma (CCA) is a highly lethal malignancy originating from the 
      biliary tract and characterized with exposure to high levels of bile acids (BAs). 
      Immunotherapies have demonstrated limited efficacy in CCA, but the underlying 
      mechanism remains elusive. In this study, we reveal that the excessive BAs 
      specifically activate GPBAR1 on cancer-associated fibroblasts (CAFs) to express 
      high levels of CXCL10, enhancing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and 
      metastasis of CCA cells and creating an immunosuppressive tumor microenvironment 
      (TME) by recruiting neutrophils in CCA. Interestingly, single-cell RNA sequencing 
      analysis demonstrates that CAFs in CCA, but not other cancer types examined, 
      specifically express GPBAR1, a receptor for BAs. GPBAR1-CXCL10 axis inhibition 
      enhances the efficacy of pembrolizumab in multiple CCA preclinical models. High 
      BA levels and upregulated GPBAR1 expression predict poor prognosis and inferior 
      immunotherapy response. In summary, our study reveals an immunosuppressive 
      mechanism of BAs and identifies GPBAR1 and CXCL10 as potential immunotherapeutic 
      targets in CCA.

AB  - Pathologically activated immunosuppressive neutrophils impair cancer 
      immunotherapy efficacy. The chemokine receptor CXCR4, a central regulator of 
      hematopoiesis and neutrophil biology, represents an attractive target. Here, we 
      fuse a secreted CXCR4 partial agonist, trefoil factor 2 (TFF2), to mouse serum 
      albumin (MSA) and demonstrate that TFF2-MSA peptide synergizes with anti-PD-1 to 
      inhibit primary tumor growth and distant metastases and prolongs survival in 
      gastric cancer (GC) mouse models. Using histidine decarboxylase (Hdc)-GFP 
      transgenic mice to track polymorphonuclear myeloid-derived suppressor cell 
      (PMN-MDSC) in vivo, we find that TFF2-MSA selectively reduces the 
      Hdc-GFP(+)CXCR4(high) immunosuppressive neutrophils, thereby boosting CD8(+) T 
      cell-mediated tumor killing with anti-PD-1. Importantly, TFF2-MSA reduces bone 
      marrow granulopoiesis, contrasting with CXCR4 antagonism, which fails to confer 
      therapeutic benefits. In GC patients, elevated CXCR4(+)LOX-1(+) low-density 
      neutrophils correlate with lower circulating TFF2 levels. Collectively, our 
      studies introduce a strategy that utilizes CXCR4 partial agonism to restore 
      anti-PD-1 sensitivity by targeting immunosuppressive neutrophils and 
      granulopoiesis.

AB  - Lung cancer is a significant hazard to human health, with limited treatment 
      options. Although CDK4/6 inhibitors like Palbociclib (Palb) have shown clinical 
      promise, their effectiveness is often compromised by resistance. Our findings 
      indicate that the Palb may promote M2-like macrophage polarization, which can 
      facilitate tumor progression through immunosuppression. This study investigates 
      the effect of Polyphyllin I (PPI) in counteracting Palb-induced M2 macrophage 
      polarization and explored its synergistic anti-tumor potential when combined with 
      Palb. In vitro, a macrophage polarization model showed that Palb enhanced the 
      expression of M2 macrophage markers, which could be reversed by PPI. LLC cells 
      were cultured with macrophage-conditioned medium (CM) showed that the PPI and 
      Palb combination-CM group exhibited decreased proliferation, migration, and 
      invasion capabilities in LLC cells and inhibited epithelial-mesenchymal 
      transition (EMT) compared to the Palb-CM group. Moreover, the combination of PPI 
      and Palb also enhanced anti-tumor effect in vivo. Mechanistically, the JAK-STAT 
      pathway was enriched, and key signaling proteins associated with macrophage 
      polarization, including TWEAK, p-JAK1 and p-STAT1, were significantly upregulated 
      in the PPI-treated group. PPI can reverse Palb-induced M2 polarization by 
      activating the TWEAK/JAK1/STAT1 signaling pathway, which can enhance the 
      anti-tumor efficacy of Palb. These findings support PPI as a potential adjunct to 
      CDK4/6 inhibitors for lung cancer therapy.

AB  - PURPOSE: To identify the optimal therapeutic strategy for Locally Advanced 
      Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma (LA-NPC). METHODS: Herein, four databases (PubMed, Web 
      of Science, Embase, and Cochrane Library) were systematically searched for 
      pertinent articles from inception to May 24, 2024. Risk of Bias (ROB) was 
      assessed using Cochrane's risk of bias tool 2.0. Statistical analyses were 
      performed using Stata 16.0 and R 4.4.0. RESULTS: The final analysis included 46 
      studies involving 15,667 patients. Compared to the Concurrent Chemoradiotherapy 
      (CCRT) + Adjuvant Chemotherapy (AC) combination therapy, the Induction 
      Chemotherapy (IC) + CCRT + Epidermal Growth Factor Receptor Antibody (anti-EGFR) 
      combination treatment demonstrated better efficacy in improving Overall Survival 
      (OS) (Hazard Ratio [HR]: 0.52; 95 % Confidence Interval [CI]: 0.33-0.83). The 
      Surface Under the Cumulative Ranking (SUCRA) analysis revealed that the IC + CCRT 
      + AC + anti-EGFR combination ranked the highest in terms of OS, with a SUCRA 
      score of 87.49 %. It also ranked the highest in terms of Distant Metastasis-Free 
      Survival (DMFS), with a SUCRA score of 85.90 %. Additionally, the CCRT + 
      anti-EGFR combination therapy ranked the highest in terms of PFS, with a SUCRA 
      score of 77.21 %, while the IC + RT combination had the fewest Adverse Effects 
      (AEs) (3-4 grade), with a SUCRA score of 86.20 %. CONCLUSION: The IC + CCRT + 
      AC + anti-EGFR combination therapy significantly improved OS, DMFS, and LRFS, 
      highlighting its great promise in LA-NPC treatment. However, owing to the 
      relatively few studies on immunotherapy and targeted therapy, more well-designed 
      studies will be required to validate this deduction.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma (RCC) has changed 
      dramatically in the last few years, with different options being available, and 
      with no data comparing these new systemic therapies. Therefore, the value of 
      real-world outcomes (RWO) becomes of great interest to understand the 
      effectiveness of these treatments. Here we analyze the outcome of metastatic RCC 
      patients treated with first-line cabozantinib in a retrospective cohort from the 
      Czech Republic and Poland METHODS: Patients with metastatic RCC treated with 
      first-line cabozantinib in the Czech Republic and Poland were included in a 
      retrospective fashion. Data were collected regarding progression-free survival 
      (PFS), overall survival (OS), response rate and toxicity, with a focus in several 
      subgroups of interest. RESULTS: We identified 146 patients, the majority of them 
      (80.8%) with clear cell RCC (ccRCC). The median OS was 14.7 months, and the 
      median PFS 8.2 months, with a response rate of 30.3%. CTCAE v3.0 grade 3+4 
      toxicity was presented in 34.2% of patients. The efficacy of Cabozantinib was 
      maintained regardless of histologic subtype and the presence of sarcomatoid 
      component, although PFS and OS data were numerically better for nonclear cell 
      RCC. Bone and liver metastases were confirmed as independent factor for poor 
      survival in the multivariate analysis. CONCLUSIONS: In our series, Cabozantinib 
      demonstrated its activity in RCC patients in a RWO setting. Our data can be 
      considered comparable with what has been seen in randomised clinical trials, 
      considering the inherent bias present in RWO studies.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Hepatoblastoma is the most common pediatric liver 
      cancer and represents a serious clinical challenge as no effective therapies have 
      yet been found for advanced states and relapses of the disease. METHODS: In this 
      work, we use a well-established agent-based model of the immune response now 
      equipped with anti-cancer therapy response to study the evolution of the disease 
      and the role of the immune system in its containment. RESULTS: We simulate the 
      course of hepatoblastoma over three years in a population of virtual patients, 
      successfully mimicking clinical mortality and symptom onset rates, as well as 
      observations on the main tumor transcriptomic subtypes. CONCLUSIONS: The capacity 
      of the introduced framework to reproduce clinical data and the heterogeneity of 
      hepatoblastoma, combined with the possibility of observing the dynamics of 
      cellular entities at the microscopic scale and the key chemical signals involved 
      in disease progression, makes the model a promising resource for future research 
      on in silico trials.

AB  - BACKGROUND: We report a pilot clinical trial investigating the feasibility of 
      liquid biopsy genotyping (LBG) at the time of radiological suspicion of advanced 
      NSCLC, incorporating a micro-cost model (MCM). (PLAsma Genomic Testing in 
      Advanced NSCLC; The PLAN trial, ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT05542485). 
      METHODS: Patients with a radiologic suspicion of stage III-IV lung cancer were 
      recruited from four cancer centres in Ireland between August 2023 and July 2024. 
      LBG was performed using the Archer LiquidplexTM NGS assay. The MCM considered 
      staff time, consumables and capital costs and savings from avoidance of repeat 
      tissue biopsy genotyping (TBG) or inappropriate systemic therapy such as 
      immunotherapy for EGFR + NSCLC. RESULTS: A total of 138 patients were enrolled in 
      the study with 38 excluded from the primary analysis (Squamous=16; SCLC = 22). Of 
      patients that were eligible, LBG was completed in 100 % (100/100). TBG was 
      completed in 68 % (68/100; insufficient tissue 20 %; 20/100; declining ECOG PS 
      12 %; 12/100). Repeat tissue biopsies were avoided in 12 % (12/100) of patients 
      due to available LBG reports. The median calendar days from LBG to receipt of 
      genomic report was 21 days shorter for LBG (z = -6.8, p < 0.01) versus TBG, as a 
      median (range: 1-104 days). For evaluable paired cases with both TBG and LBG 
      available (n = 68), concordance was 90 % (61/68). LBG resulted in detection of 5 
      actionable variants. LBG (euro1135) was less than half the cost of TBG (euro2404). LBG 
      also resulted in overall cost savings of euro20,288 (reduced TBG; use of 
      immunotherapy). CONCLUSIONS: LBG reduces the time to genomic diagnosis in 
      patients with newly diagnosed NSCLC compared to tissue genotyping, identifies 
      actionable variants not reported in tissue, and results in overall cost savings.

AB  - Tumor heterogeneity disrupts the consistent expression of target markers, leading 
      to inefficient tumor targeting and contributing to drug resistance and relapse. 
      Therefore, seeking a more universal target is crucial for enhancing drug 
      enrichment in tumors. In this study, we propose a self-amplifying tumor-targeting 
      strategy that leverages externalized phosphatidylserine (PtdSer) on apoptotic 
      cells as a universal target. The system is composed of a Red Blood Cell-Liposome 
      hybrid membrane camouflaged Mn-Ce6 nanocomplex, which is further modified with a 
      PtdSer aptamer (MC@RL/Apt). MC@RL/Apt demonstrates prolonged circulation time and 
      enhanced tumor accumulation, capable of inducing cancer cell apoptosis and PtdSer 
      externalization under 660 nm light irradiation. The externalized PtdSer is then 
      recognized by the PtdSer aptamer, which recruits additional MC@RL/Apt to the 
      tumor site, facilitating a self-amplified tumor accumulation effect. In vitro 
      studies show that MC@RL/Apt acted as an efferocytosis inhibitor, suppressing 
      macrophage phagocytosis of apoptotic cells and promoting macrophage polarization 
      toward the pro-inflammatory M1 phenotype. Compared to non-functionalized MC@RL, 
      intravenous administration of MC@RL/Apt increases tumor accumulation by 1.46-fold 
      under 660 nm light irradiation. As a result, treatment with MC@RL/Apt effectively 
      suppressed tumor growth and induced robust antitumor immune responses. This work 
      highlights a self-amplifying tumor-targeting strategy that leverages externalized 
      PtdSer on apoptotic cells as a target to enhance tumor-specific drug delivery, 
      while simultaneously inhibiting PtdSer-mediated macrophage engulfment, offering a 
      promising approach for improving cancer therapy outcomes.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1)-negative status is 
      associated with poor response to immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI); however, the 
      underlying reasons remain unclear. Hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 alpha (HNF4alpha) is a 
      nuclear receptor mutually exclusive with TTF-1 and is associated with cancer cell 
      proliferation and metastasis. This study evaluated the impact of HNF4alpha expression 
      on survival outcomes in patients with TTF-1-negative non-squamous non-small cell 
      lung cancer (non-Sq NSCLC) treated with ICI. METHODS: We conducted this 
      single-center retrospective study that analyzed patients with advanced or 
      recurrent non-Sq NSCLC who received ICI therapy. Based on immunohistochemical 
      analysis, the patients were classified into three groups: (1) TTF-1 negative and 
      HNF4alpha positive, (2) TTF-1 negative and HNF4alpha negative, and (3) TTF-1 positive. 
      Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate overall survival (OS), and the 
      log-rank test was used to compare intergroup differences. RESULTS: 388 patients 
      treated with ICI were included: 54 TTF-1 negative HNF4alpha positive, 48 TTF-1 
      negative HNF4alpha negative, and 286 TTF-1 positive. The median OS was significantly 
      worse in the TTF-1-negative HNF4alpha-positive group than in the TTF-1-positive group 
      (12.0 vs. 32.3 months; Hazard ratio (HR): 2.14 [95 % confidence interval (CI): 
      1.54-2.99], p < 0.001). Meanwhile, the median OS of the TTF-1-negative 
      HNF4alpha-positive group was equivalent to that of the TTF-1-positive group (32.2 vs. 
      32.3 months; HR: 1.03 [95 % CI: 0.68-1.54], p = 0.90). Multivariate analysis 
      identified HNF4alpha as an independent poor prognostic factor. Subgroup analyses 
      restricted to patients with adenocarcinoma and those receiving first-line 
      chemo-immunotherapy demonstrated similar trends. CONCLUSION: HNF4alpha expression in 
      TTF-1-negative non-Sq NSCLC was associated with worse prognosis in patients 
      treated with ICI.

AB  - Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, 
      accounting for 18 % of all cancer deaths. The limitations of conventional 
      therapies, such as chemotherapy, are exacerbated by multidrug resistance (MDR) 
      and systemic toxicity, underscoring the urgent need for innovative treatment 
      strategies. Nanotechnology, particularly silver nanoparticles (AgNPs), shows 
      potential in overcoming MDR by modulating key transporters and associated 
      pathways, providing a promising approach for site-specific drug delivery with 
      reduced adverse effects. AgNPs exhibit significant cytotoxic and apoptotic 
      effects in lung cancer cell lines through mechanisms involving gene regulation, 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and mitochondrial depolarization. 
      Biosynthesized AgNPs, particularly those derived from plant extracts, demonstrate 
      enhanced biocompatibility and reduced toxicity. Their anticancer potential has 
      been validated in both in vitro and in vivo models, showing dose-dependent 
      reductions in cell viability, cell cycle arrest, and apoptosis induction. 
      Furthermore, AgNPs can modulate the tumor microenvironment and inhibit 
      angiogenesis, paving the way for targeted lung cancer therapies. Advances such as 
      functionalized AgNPs and their integration into photodynamic therapy further 
      enhance their therapeutic potential. However, challenges related to off-target 
      toxicity and clinical translation remain. Continued research is essential to 
      fully harness AgNPs' potential, bridging the gap between treatment efficacy and 
      safety in lung cancer therapy.

      Therapy.
LID - 10.1021/acsami.5c08291 [doi]
AB  - Nanocatalysts with extraordinary activity have attracted extensive research 
      interest and great potential in tumor therapy. However, the widely explored 
      Cu-based copper sulfide-enabled cancer therapy suffers from limited catalytic 
      efficiency. This is primarily attributed to the susceptibility of single-phase 
      nanocrystalline catalysts to complexation within the homogeneous catalyst and the 
      complex tumor microenvironment (TME). Developing nanocatalysts with a broad 
      energy band and high oxidative as well as reductive capacities remains a 
      significant challenge. Herein, we first constructed a heterojunction (HJ)-based 
      nanophotocatalytic platform, denoted as Cu(7)S(4)-In(2)S(3)@GOx@PEG, CIGP, 
      wherein glucose oxidase (GOx) and poly(ethylene glycol) were modified on the 
      Cu(7)S(4)-In(2)S(3) HJs. The developed CIGP showed excellent phototriggered 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation ability via reaction with O(2) and 
      H(2)O(2), owing to the Cu(7)S(4)-In(2)S(3) HJs, in which the spatial separation 
      dynamics of photogenerated electrons-holes was improved. In addition, the 
      modified GOx of CIGP can catalyze the conversion of glucose into hydrogen 
      peroxide (H(2)O(2)) and gluconic acid, thereby regulating the pH of the TME and 
      altering the redox dynamic balance to favor ROS accumulation. Under irradiation, 
      CIGP inhibited the growth of tumor cells by spatiotemporal controllable 
      photothermal therapy. Taken together, CIGP provided an innovative paradigm for 
      remodeling the acidity of the TME and synergistically enhancing the antitumor 
      response.

AB  - The high heterogeneity of tumor microenvironment (TME) is a key factor affecting 
      immunotherapy. We integrated immunotherapy related scRNA-seq and bulk datasets to 
      analyze the TME, mine key factors and dissect the mechanism in immunotherapy. 
      Analyzing the cell composition of TME in cancer immunotherapy, we revealed key 
      TME cell types, including B cells, CD8+ T cells and fibroblasts. Through cell 
      subsets identification, pseudo-time sequence and functional status analysis of 
      malignant cells, it was found that the functional status of malignant cell was 
      heterogeneous under different immunotherapy conditions. Key cellular interactions 
      in cancer immunotherapy were also revealed. Further, 16 marker genes and 6 marker 
      cell types of cancer immunotherapy were identified, and then gene and cell model 
      were constructed to predict the immunotherapy response of individuals, and the 
      model were evaluated based on multiple independent validation datasets. This 
      study can provide important guidance for improving the efficiency and 
      understanding the mechanism of cancer immunotherapy.

TI  - BO-112 Plus Pembrolizumab for Patients With Anti-PD-1-Resistant Advanced 
      Melanoma: Phase II Clinical Trial SPOTLIGHT-203.
PG  - JCO2402595
LID - 10.1200/JCO-24-02595 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Patients with anti-PD-1-resistant melanoma (MEL) have no well-defined 
      standard of care. BO-112 is a synthetic, double-stranded RNA (poly I:C) 
      nanoplexed with polyethylenimine that when administered intratumorally has showed 
      in patients with solid tumors potential to revert this resistance. We report 
      efficacy and safety of the phase II clinical trial of intratumoral BO-112 plus 
      intravenous pembrolizumab for patients with anti-PD-1-resistant MEL 
      (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04570332). METHODS: Forty-two patients were 
      treated with intratumoral BO-112 once every week for 7 weeks and then once every 
      3 weeks (up to 2 mg and up to eight lesions per treatment) combined with 200 mg 
      pembrolizumab once every 3 weeks until progressive disease, unacceptable 
      toxicity, death, or up to 1 year. Primary end point was RECIST 1.1 objective 
      response rate (ORR) by independent central radiology review in modified 
      intention-to-treat population (mITT; patients evaluable for response) with 20% 
      ORR positivity threshold. Secondary key end points were progression-free survival 
      (PFS), overall survival (OS), duration of response (DOR), and safety. RESULTS: 
      For mITT, there were 40 patients and the ORR was 25%, with 10% complete, 15% 
      partial, and 40% stable disease, with nonachieved (NA) median DOR (95% CI, 8.3 to 
      NA). For ITT, there were 42 patients, and the median PFS and OS were 3.7 months 
      (95% CI, 2.2 to 9.2) and NA (95% CI, 9.9 to NA), respectively, with 54% patients 
      alive at 24 months. The combination was well tolerated: 16 patients (38.1%) 
      experiencing >/=G3-4 adverse events, four (9.5%) drug-related, and no deaths 
      related to treatment. CONCLUSION: The clinical trial has met its primary end 
      point (ORR) making BO-112 with pembrolizumab a potential strategy to revert 
      anti-PD-1 resistance in patients with MEL. PFS results are in line with other 
      clinical trials in anti-PD-1-resistant scenario, with promising OS data.

AB  - While cancer immunotherapy has primarily focused on CD8 T cells, CD4 T cells are 
      increasingly recognized for their role in antitumor immunity. The HLA-DRB3*02:02 
      allele is found in 50% of Caucasians. In this study, we screened HLA-DRB3*02:02 
      patients with melanoma for tumor-specific CD4 T cells and identified robust New 
      York esophageal squamous cell carcinoma 1 (NY-ESO-1)(123-137)/HLA-DRB3*02:02 CD4 
      T cell activity in both peripheral blood and tumor tissue. By analyzing 
      NY-ESO-1(123-137)/HLA-DRB3*02:02-restricted CD4 T cell clones, we uncovered an 
      unexpectedly high cytotoxicity, strong T helper 1 polarization, and recurrent alphabeta 
      T cell receptor (TCRalphabeta) usage across patients and anatomical sites. These 
      responses were also present in other NY-ESO-1-expressing cancers. TCRs from these 
      clones, when transduced into primary CD4 T cells, showed direct antitumor 
      efficacy both in vitro and in vivo. Our findings suggest that these TCRs are 
      promising for adoptive T cell transfer therapy, enabling broader targeting of 
      NY-ESO-1-expressing adult and pediatric cancers in clinical settings.

LID - 10.1126/sciadv.adr1728 [doi]
AB  - The low immunogenicity and immune escape are bottlenecks for effective tumor 
      immunotherapy. Here, we synthesized multifunctional polymers comprising a 
      photosensitizer and cationic and thiol derivates and engineered a 
      galactose-installed stimulator of interferon genes (STING) agonist and programmed 
      death ligand 1 (PD-L1) small interfering RNA (siPDL1)-encapsulated nanocarriers 
      (cGAMP-siPDL1@GalNPs) for synergistic immunotherapy of low immunogenic tumors 
      through stimulating robust immune responses. cGAMP-siPDL1@GalNPs efficiently 
      delivered the drugs into cancer cells by targeting the galactose receptors to 
      trigger photo-/redox-/pH-activated drug release. cGAMP-siPDL1@GalNPs stimulated 
      robust antitumor immunity via STING activation and immunogenic cell death (ICD) 
      and inhibited immune escape via knockdown of PD-L1 expression in tumors, which 
      synergistically regulated the immune-suppressive tumor microenvironment. Upon 
      laser irradiation, the nanocarriers efficiently eradicated primary melanoma and 
      orthotopic triple-negative breast tumors and induced ICD effects, which 
      synergically inhibited the distant tumor and spontaneous lung metastasis with 
      improved survival rates. This study presents a strategy for developing 
      nanocarriers to activate antitumor immunity and regulate immune invasion for 
      effective immunotherapy.

TI  - Radiotherapy enhances anticancer CD8 T cell responses by cGAMP transfer through 
      LRRC8A/C volume-regulated anion channels.
PG  - eadn1630
LID - 10.1126/sciimmunol.adn1630 [doi]
AB  - The volume-regulated anion channels (VRACs) transport osmolytes, 
      neurotransmitters, and cyclic GMP-AMP (cGAMP) across the cell membrane to 
      regulate cell volume and host defense. We report that the leucine-rich 
      repeat-containing 8A/C (LRRC8A/C) VRAC plays a crucial role in immune responses 
      to radiotherapy and chemotherapy for cancer. VRACs transfer cGAMP from irradiated 
      cancer cells to infiltrating CD4 and CD8 T cells, thus enhancing their effector 
      functions. TCR signaling acts as a physiological signal to open the VRAC pore 
      through phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate [PI(4,5)P(2)] and reactive oxygen 
      species (ROS). This allows the rapid uptake of cGAMP and STING activation in 
      mouse and human T cells and induction of interferon-alpha/beta, which up-regulate 
      granzymes and IFN-gamma in CD8 T cells. Inhibition of the extracellular hydroxylases 
      CD39 and ENPP1 maintains extracellular ATP and cGAMP, which promotes 
      VRAC-enhanced CD8 T cell anticancer function. Thus, the transfer of cGAMP to T 
      cells by VRACs may be a strategy that can be targeted in future cancer therapies.

TI  - Riplet promotes lipid metabolism changes associated with CD8 T cell exhaustion 
      and anti-PD-1 resistance in hepatocellular carcinoma.
PG  - eado3485
LID - 10.1126/sciimmunol.ado3485 [doi]
AB  - The overall response rate to immunotherapy is modest in hepatocellular carcinoma 
      (HCC), and immunotherapy resistance mechanisms are incompletely understood. We 
      report that the E3 ubiquitin ligase Riplet is universally silenced by promoter 
      hypermethylation in HCC. Loss of Riplet modulates fatty acid metabolism to 
      promote terminal exhaustion of CD8 T cells. Riplet loss impedes K48-linked 
      polyubiquitination of fatty acid synthase (FASN), consequently accelerating fatty 
      acid production in HCC. Tumor cell-derived free fatty acids, especially palmitic 
      acid (PA/C16:0), activate STAT3 (signal transducers and activators of 
      transcription 3) by enhancing its palmitoylation in T cells, consequently 
      triggering terminal CD8 T cell exhaustion. HCC cells with Riplet deficiency are 
      resistant to anti-PD-1 therapy, and treatment with an FASN inhibitor overcomes 
      resistance. Our study shows how Riplet can alter lipid metabolism and induce CD8 
      T cell exhaustion and anti-PD-1 resistance, thus suggesting avenues for combined 
      therapies for treating patients with Riplet-deficient HCC.

TI  - scRepertoire 2: Enhanced and efficient toolkit for single-cell immune profiling.
PG  - e1012760
LID - 10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012760 [doi]
AB  - Single-cell adaptive immune receptor repertoire sequencing (scAIRR-seq) and 
      single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) provide a transformative approach to 
      profiling immune responses at unprecedented resolution across diverse 
      pathophysiologic contexts. This work presents scRepertoire 2, a substantial 
      update to our R package for analyzing and visualizing single-cell immune receptor 
      data. This new version introduces an array of features designed to enhance both 
      the depth and breadth of immune receptor analysis, including improved workflows 
      for clonotype tracking, repertoire diversity metrics, and novel visualization 
      modules that facilitate longitudinal and comparative studies. Additionally, 
      scRepertoire 2 offers seamless integration with contemporary single-cell analysis 
      frameworks like Seurat and SingleCellExperiment, allowing users to conduct 
      end-to-end single-cell immune profiling with transcriptomic data. Performance 
      optimizations in scRepertoire 2 resulted in a 85.1% increase in speed and a 91.9% 
      reduction in memory usage from the first version over the range repertoire size 
      tested in benchmarking, addressing the demands of the ever-increasing size and 
      scale of single-cell studies. This release marks an advancement in single cell 
      immunogenomics, equipping researchers with a robust toolset to uncover immune 
      dynamics in health and disease.

TI  - Effects of Intermittent Fasting and Calorie Restriction on Exercise Performance: 
      A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 1992 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17121992 [doi]
AB  - Context: Intermittent fasting (IF) and calorie restriction (CR) have gained 
      interest as dietary strategies due to their potential for weight loss and 
      multiple metabolic benefits. These strategies are often accompanied by exercise 
      in an attempt to improve body composition and physical performance. However, 
      further research is crucial to understanding whether or not physical performance 
      is affected by the expected weight loss and related body composition changes in 
      individuals on IF and CR, even when exercise is combined. Objective: We aimed to 
      systematically evaluate the effects of IF and CR on exercise performance and body 
      composition in adults aged 18 to 65 years. Data Source: A systematic review and 
      meta-analysis of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was conducted following the 
      Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) 
      statement. A systematic review was conducted up to April 2024 by searching 
      electronic databases, including PubMed, Web of Science, and Scopus. There was no 
      limit on publication dates. Data Extraction: The search explored the impact of IF 
      and CR combined with exercise vs. exercise alone (control) on exercise 
      performance outcomes: VO(2max), handgrip strength, bench press strength, knee 
      extensor strength, leg press strength, countermovement jump (CMJ), 400 m walk 
      test, and gait speed; body weight, body mass index (BMI), and body composition: 
      fat-free mass (FFM), fat mass (FM), and body fat percentage (BFP). Analyses 
      included calculation of weighted mean difference (WMD), standardized mean 
      difference (SMD), and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) to assess outcomes. Data 
      Analysis: The meta-analysis included a total of 35 studies, ranging from 4 to 52 
      weeks and involving 1266 participants. The results showed that IF (hypocaloric or 
      eucaloric diet) and CR combined with exercise increased handgrip strength [WMD = 
      1.707 kg, p = 0.01] compared to exercise alone. Moreover, IF and CR combined with 
      exercise did not significantly affect VO(2max) [SMD = 0.005, p = 0.94], bench 
      press strength [WMD = 0.377 kg, p = 0.778], knee extensor strength [WMD = -4.729 
      kg, p = 0.12], leg press strength [WMD = -2.874 kg, p = 0.415], countermovement 
      jump [WMD = -0.226 cm, p = 0.80], 400 m walk test performance [WMD = -8.794 s, p 
      = 0.06], or gait speed [WMD = 0.005 m/s, p = 0.82] compared to exercise alone. 
      Moreover, IF and CR combined with exercise decreased body weight [WMD = -4.375 
      kg, p = 0.001], BMI [WMD = -1.194 kg.m(-2), p = 0.001], FFM [WMD = -1.653 kg, p = 
      0.001], FM [WMD = -2.858 kg, p = 0.001], BFP [WMD = -0.826%, p = 0.001] compared 
      to exercise alone. Conclusions: IF (hypocaloric or eucaloric) and CR can be 
      effectively integrated into exercise training without negatively impacting most 
      measures of physical performance, while significantly enhancing weight loss and 
      adiposity-related outcomes. The findings from this meta-analysis involving both 
      athletes and non-athletes suggest that weight loss induced by IF and CR combined 
      with exercise does not necessarily result in reduced physical performance. In 
      real-world scenarios, however, different outcomes are conceivable, as body 
      composition, physical capacity, diet and exercise can vary considerably based on 
      individual conditions.

      Morphometrical, Hematological, and Biochemical Changes in Female Mice, but Not in

AB  - Margarine is a popular high-calorie component of the Western diet and was shown 
      to be associated with the development of metabolic syndrome. Intermittent fasting 
      (IF) is an effective approach to improve health and prevent metabolic disorders. 
      This study aimed to investigate the effects of margarine consumption, both ad 
      libitum and in combination with IF regimens, using young C57BL/6J mice of both 
      sexes. Female mice fed margarine ad libitum as a supplement to the standard diet 
      showed significant body mass gain, reduced food intake, lower blood paraoxonase 
      activity, and higher lipid peroxide (LOOH) levels, along with higher activities 
      of antioxidant enzymes in the liver. Margarine-fed males showed higher food 
      intake and had lower blood triacylglycerol levels, higher LOOH levels in adipose 
      tissue, and lower LOOH levels in the liver than their control counterparts. When 
      a margarine-supplemented diet was provided to mice with an IF regimen, males 
      gained body mass faster and experienced severe metabolic changes, including 
      elevated fasting blood glucose levels, higher total leukocyte count, 
      triacylglycerol accumulation, and reduced glycogen levels in the liver compared 
      to their margarine ad libitum counterparts. Females treated with margarine + IF 
      showed a partial improvement in metabolic status and a decrease in 
      proinflammatory markers compared to the group receiving margarine ad libitum. 
      Hence, responses to the diets were sex-specific. Females that consumed margarine 
      ad libitum had higher metabolic sensitivity than males. Meanwhile, IF provided 
      some protective effects in females but worsened metabolic outcomes in males when 
      combined with a high-fat margarine diet.

AB  - Intermittent fasting (IF) has emerged as a widely practiced dietary regimen, 
      increasingly utilized in both clinical and non-clinical settings for its 
      potential health benefits. Evidence suggests that IF can improve metabolic health 
      by enhancing insulin sensitivity, reducing inflammation, and aiding weight 
      management. Recent studies have also explored its role in mitigating 
      obesity-related diseases, such as type 2 diabetes and non-alcoholic fatty liver 
      disease, and its ability to support cardiovascular health and mental function. 
      The effects of IF, however, vary depending on individual health conditions. Some 
      patients show no clinical improvement, while others experience worsened outcomes. 
      Mechanistically, IF induces metabolic switching and activates adenosine 
      monophosphate-activated protein kinase (AMPK), both of which contribute to its 
      therapeutic potential. These responses are influenced by factors such as 
      underlying pathology, baseline metabolic state, and dietary composition. While 
      preclinical data indicate potential therapeutic effects in diseases like cancer, 
      rheumatoid arthritis, and neurodegenerative conditions, these findings are not 
      yet sufficiently supported by human studies. This review argues that IF holds 
      promise as a disease-modifying intervention. However, its implementation should 
      be personalized according to patient-specific characteristics, and future 
      clinical trials must prioritize identifying optimal fasting protocols to maximize 
      therapeutic outcomes.

AB  - Time-restricted feeding (TRF) may aid in weight loss and improve metabolic 
      health; however, its long-term effects and applicability to all individuals 
      remain unclear. This study investigated the impact of different dietary patterns 
      on hepatic metabolism by subjecting mice to either a normal chow diet or a 
      high-fat diet, allowing for ad libitum feeding, daytime restrictive feeding 
      (DRF), or nighttime restrictive feeding (NRF). Using metabolic cages to assess 
      energy intake, we found that the fuel utilization rhythms of DRF mice were 
      disrupted compared to ad libitum-fed mice. Mice on normal chow DRF exhibited only 
      dyslipidemia, while those on high-fat DRF developed lean metabolic 
      dysfunction-associated fatty liver disease (MAFLD), characterized by more 
      pronounced dyslipidemia, weight loss, and hepatic lipid accumulation. RNA seq 
      revealed that CD36 plays a crucial role in the development of lean MAFLD induced 
      by high-fat DRF by inhibiting AMPK phosphorylation, disrupting the balance 
      between lipogenesis and oxidation. Mechanistic validation was performed in CD36 
      liver-specific knockout mice and Liposomal nanoparticles injection models. These 
      findings provide new insights into the potential mechanisms linking feeding 
      patterns to lean MAFLD. Additionally, CD36 emerges as a potential therapeutic 
      target for high-fat-induced lean MAFLD. Clarifying the relationship between DRF 
      and lean MAFLD may inform guidelines for specific populations, such as 
      individuals practicing intermittent fasting or those working night shifts, while 
      also suggesting potential therapeutic strategies for clinical management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intermittent fasting holds promise as a prevention for obesity, but 
      its effects on established obesity remain uncertain. METHODS: We examined two 
      intermittent fasting regimens in diet-induced obese mice, either maintained on a 
      hypercaloric diet or switched to normal chow diet, and compared their effects 
      with those of dietary switch alone (12 mice/group). We assessed metabolic 
      parameters, gut microbiota composition, and fasting and postprandial short-chain 
      fatty acids (SCFAs) levels. Additionally, faecal microbiota was analysed before 
      and after diet-induced weight loss in 18 individuals with obesity. FINDINGS: 
      Intermittent fasting with a hypercaloric diet effectively mitigated weight gain 
      and improved metabolic health-glucose, insulin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, 
      and glucose tolerance (p < 0.05) to an extent comparable with dietary switch. 
      Intermittent fasting increased faecal SCFAs levels, especially postprandially 
      (acetate, propionate, and butyrate, p < 0.05), mirroring dietary switch. 
      Combining intermittent fasting with dietary switch yielded the greatest 
      improvement in glucose tolerance (p < 0.01) and exerted a more pronounced effect 
      on gut microbiota composition (28 significant genera), albeit with reduced SCFA 
      changes. The relative abundance of Alistipes finegoldii was associated with 
      postprandial SCFAs levels and/or metabolic parameters in both mice and humans. 
      INTERPRETATION: Intermittent fasting on a hypercaloric diet protects against 
      obesity, while combining intermittent fasting with dietary switch improves 
      glucose metabolism independently of body weight. Both effects are associated with 
      specific microbiota changes and postprandial SCFA dynamics, highlighting the 
      connection between intermittent fasting, microbiota, and metabolic health.

AB  - This work was conducted under the auspices of the Moroccan Society of 
      Rheumatology (SMR) with the aim of developing best practice medical guidelines 
      for the dietary management of patients with Chronic Inflammatory Rheumatic 
      Diseases (IRDs). A working group composed of rheumatology experts and two 
      nutritionists was formed. This group relied on a synthesis of the literature and 
      expert opinions. These guidelines were then validated by a group of rheumatology 
      experts. The methodology followed the procedure proposed by the European League 
      Against Rheumatism (EULAR). Five general principles and eleven recommendations 
      were established. These principles emphasise that diet should complement, rather 
      than replace, pharmacological treatment and should be integrated into the overall 
      management of patients with IRDs. Additionally, it should be associated with 
      appropriate physical activity and take cultural and socio-economic context into 
      account. These recommendations highlight the importance of weight loss for 
      overweight or obese patients and advocate for the Mediterranean diet as well as a 
      diet rich in omega-3. However, exclusion diets such as gluten-free, vegetarian, 
      and dairy-free diets, as well as supplementation with probiotics or spices, are 
      currently not recommended for patients with IRDs. Supplementation with vitamins 
      or trace elements is not systematically recommended, and the data concerning 
      Ramadan fasting or intermittent fasting are limited or contradictory. 
      Furthermore, two specific recommendations for the Moroccan diet were proposed. 
      These recommendations standardise dietary management in IRDs, making it 
      accessible for practitioners and patients.

AB  - Background: Intermittent fasting has become a new fad diet that may promote an 
      environment to facilitate muscle atrophy, placing aging, and diabetic populations 
      at risk for muscle loss due to nutrient deprivation. The purpose of this study 
      was to investigate how nutrient availability and serum environment influence Type 
      2 diabetic myoblast density and viability, autophagy-related oxidative and 
      inflammatory markers, and upstream gene expression signaling relevant to 
      proteostasis. Methods: To explore this outcome in human skeletal muscle myoblast 
      (HSMM) and diabetic human skeletal muscle myoblast (D-HSMM), myoblast lines were 
      cultured per standard protocol and were incubated for 12 or 24 h with either 
      human serum (HS) or fetal bovine serum (FBS) at varying serum media 
      concentrations: 5%, 10%, and 15%. Cell viability and density were determined; 
      ELISAs were used to assess SOD1 and TNFalpha; TaqMan gene array plates were used to 
      explore mRNA gene expression related to growth and atrophy. Results: Cell 
      viability (%) analysis showed that 0% concentration, 12 h incubation, and FBS 
      media have lower viability (p </= 0.0001); cell density analysis showed lower 
      values in 0% concentration and in the FBS media (p </= 0.0001); SOD1 analysis 
      showed a scaled effect (p </= 0.05) and higher concentration in HS 
      (12,795.07 +/- 677.87 pg/mL; p </= 0.0001); TNFalpha concentration was higher in HSMM 
      compared to D-HSMM (61 +/- 0.82 vs. 2.52 +/- 0.94 pg/mL; p=0.017), higher at 12 h 
      (6.07 +/- 0.88 vs. 2.50 +/- 0.88 pg/mL; p=0.006), and higher in FBS (6.05 +/- 0.88 vs. 
      2.08 +/- 0.88 pg/mL; p=0.002); no meaningful increase in fold change was seen in 
      mRNA. Conclusions: Myoblast viability and density were lower in the 
      nutrient-deprived conditions and in the FBS compared to the HS serum. The 
      biomarker of oxidative stress was lower in the serum concentration in a scaled 
      effect, yet higher in HS. The biomarker of inflammation was higher in the HSMM 
      cell line, shorter incubation time period, and in FBS. HS used as a media may 
      supply nutrients and hormonal confounders that may support or stress myoblast 
      growth.

AB  - The objective of the present study was to investigate the impact of single or 
      combined use of intermittent fasting and probiotics, which have been recommended 
      as an alternative to antibiotics in recent years due to their proven efficacy, 
      against Campylobacter colonization in mice. For this purpose, mice infected with 
      Campylobacter jejuni were divided into groups and exposed to intermittent fasting 
      and probiotics, alone and together. At the end of the experimental study, ileum 
      and cecum contents were obtained for microbiological analyzes, and stomach and 
      intestinal tissue samples were collected for histopathological analyzes. It was 
      determined that the level of C. jejuni colonization in the ileum and cecum of 
      mice in the positive control group (PC group) was significantly higher than in 
      the other groups (p<0.05). It was also determined that the level of C. jejuni 
      colonization in the ileum of mice in the probiotic and intermittent fasting group 
      (PB +IF group) was lower than in the other groups and the difference was 
      statistically significant (p<0.05). As a result of the histological analyzes, 
      mild inflammatory reaction was observed to occur in the stomach and intestinal 
      tissues of the animals in the experimental groups, and the severity of the 
      inflammation was lower in the PB +IF group than in the other groups. The findings 
      of this study indicate that single or combined use of intermittent fasting and 
      probiotics may represent a safe and feasible strategy for the control of 
      Campylobacter infections.

TI  - Intermittent fasting for weight loss in night shift workers: a three-arm, 
      superiority randomised clinical trial.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Weight gain and an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes are 
      recognised consequences of night shift work. We tested the effectiveness of two 
      modified intermittent fasting (IF) strategies compared with continuous energy 
      restriction (CER) on weight loss and improvements in insulin resistance in night 
      shift workers. METHODS: A parallel group, three-arm randomised superiority 
      clinical trial (Melbourne and Adelaide) recruited night shift workers (aged >/= 25 
      and </= 65 years) with overweight/obesity. Participants were randomised by 
      minimisation (site, age, gender) 1:1:1 to CER or one of two modified IF 
      strategies. For 24 weeks participants followed a diet of 2100 kJ/d for two days 
      of the week (modified IF) either on days off/day shift (IF:2D) or whilst on night 
      shift (IF:2N) and followed their usual diet on the remaining five days. 
      Co-primary outcomes were body weight and insulin resistance measured by the 
      Homeostatic Model Assessment for Insulin Resistance (HOMA-IR) at 24-weeks. 
      Participants and those assessing weight outcomes were not blinded to group 
      assignment. Researchers assessing biochemical outcomes and study statistician 
      were blinded to group assignment. Between-group differences were calculated using 
      mixed-effects regression models. FINDINGS: From October 2019 to February 2022, 
      250 participants (CER = 85; IF:2D = 83; IF:2N = 82) were randomised (mean (SD) 
      age 46.8 (9.8) years; 133 women (53.2%)), with 170 (68%) completing. No 
      significant difference between either modified IF strategy and CER for body 
      weight; IF:2D vs CER (mean difference (MD) = -0.2 kg [95% CI -6.4 to 5.9]) and 
      IF:2N vs CER (MD = -0.6 kg [95% CI -6.8 to 5.6]) and insulin resistance; IF:2D vs 
      CER (MD = -0.1 [95% CI -1.0 to 0.8]) and IF:2N vs CER (MD = -0.3 [95% CI -0.5 to 
      1.2]) were observed. For secondary outcomes, those randomised to IF:2D had lower 
      total and LDL cholesterol compared to CER ((MD = -23.2 mg/dL [95% CI -34.8 to 
      -11.6]) and (MD = -19.3 mg/dL [95% CI -30.9 to -7.7]) respectively). In a 
      completer's analysis, favourable changes in body weight, insulin resistance, body 
      composition, blood pressure, and cardiometabolic markers were observed within all 
      groups. No serious trial related adverse events were reported. INTERPRETATION: At 
      24 weeks, weight and HOMA-IR were not different between the modified IF groups 
      compared with CER. Clinically significant improvements in weight and metabolic 
      health were achieved for the majority of night shift workers who remained in the 
      intervention at 24 weeks. FUNDING: National Health and Medical Research Council

TI  - Decreased proliferation of HepG2 liver cancer cells in vitro and exhibited

      dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease who performed four-week 
      dawn-to-dusk dry fasting.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Four-week dawn-to-dusk dry fasting (DDDF) was previously shown to 
      have a potent anti-inflammatory effect and induce an anti-tumorigenic proteome in 
      the serum and peripheral blood mononuclear cells in subjects without cancer. The 
      study goal was to determine if serum obtained from these subjects without cancer 
      who underwent 4-week DDDF has an anti-tumorigenic effect. METHODS: HepG2 cells 
      were treated with serum collected from four individuals with metabolic syndrome 
      and metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and four 
      healthy individuals who performed 4-week DDDF. The objective was to assess cell 
      proliferation/viability in HepG2 cells treated with non-fasted and dry-fasted 
      serum and determine proteomic changes in human serum. We comparatively performed 
      3-[4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl]-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) cell 
      proliferation assay and untargeted proteomic analysis using nano ultra-high 
      performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. RESULTS: 
      Serum collected from 3 out of 4 subjects with metabolic syndrome and MASLD at the 
      end of 4-week DDDF (dry-fasted serum/V2) significantly reduced 
      proliferation/viability in HepG2 cells compared with the serum collected before 
      4-week DDDF (non-fasted serum/V1). A similar reduction effect on cell 
      proliferation was not observed when HepG2 cells were treated with dry-fasted 
      serum collected from healthy subjects. In addition to the in vitro changes 
      observed, the following circulating gene protein products (GP) demonstrated 
      significant increases or decreases in subjects with metabolic syndrome and MASLD 
      after a 4-week DDDF regimen, compared with their GP levels before the 4-week 
      DDDF: CD248 molecule (mean log2 fold = 8.124, P = 0.001), dipeptidyl peptidase 4 
      (mean log2 fold = 0.937, P = 0.027), lymphatic vessel endothelial hyaluronan 
      receptor 1 (mean log2 fold = 1.054, P = 0.029), LDL receptor related protein 1 
      (mean log2 fold = 1.401, P = 0.031), and beta-2-microglobulin (mean log2 fold= 
      -0.977, P = 0.033) at the end of 4-week DDDF compared with the GP levels before 
      4-week DDDF. CONCLUSION: This study demonstrated that dry-fasted serum collected 
      from subjects with metabolic syndrome and MASLD decreased HepG2 cell 
      proliferation in vitro and showed that proteomic changes occurred in vivo. These 
      findings suggest that DDDF may be an effective intervention for inducing 
      proteomic responses that could assist in the prevention and adjunct treatment of 
      cancers associated with metabolic syndrome.

TI  - A Do-it-yourself System for Scheduled Feeding of Laboratory Rodents in Their Home 
      Cage.

AB  - Intermittent fasting and research surrounding the influence of timed caloric 
      restriction on body weight regulation and aging outcomes are trending, both in 
      society and in the laboratory. To study time-restricted feeding and/or caloric 
      restriction in the laboratory, allotted quantities of food are dispersed at 
      scheduled time intervals. Current technology for scheduled feeding of rodents 
      involves either specialized cages with gated food entry ports, time-locked 
      digital hoppers, or manual food delivery. Specialized equipment for such 
      experiments can be costly and manual feeding often requires investigators to come 
      in for late night/early morning time points, precluding prolonged studies. The 
      automated feeding system described here provides a cost-effective tool for timed 
      feeding and/or caloric restriction that can be implemented on standard rodent 
      cages with minimal modifications. The protocol uses an off-the-shelf autofeeder 
      that is outfitted to a standard microisolator cage lid (mouse, hamster, rat, or 
      guinea pig cage lids) and can administer the desired food allotments at 
      programmed time intervals in the animal's home cage. Our design can be modified 
      to accept various feeders or slight variations in cage dimensions. We provide the 
      design, assembly, and protocol for the feeding system along with an alternative 
      lid and cage modification for tethered optogenetic or fiber photometry 
      experiments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Intermittent fasting (IF), particularly time-restricted feeding 
      (TRF), is increasingly popular has gained popularity for weight loss, yet 
      management, but its effects impact on gut health remain unclear. Remains 
      inadequately understood. This study explores how investigated the effects of TRF 
      effects on intestinal health and explored the underlying mechanisms. AIM: To 
      assess the effects of IF on intestinal health, elucidate the mechanisms involved. 
      METHODS: Mice were divided into two groups: Normal control (NC) and IF. The IF 
      group underwent TRF, while the NC group had unrestricted access to food. Body 
      weight, fecal characteristics, and intestinal morphology were analyzed. Colon 
      tissue, serum, and fecal samples were collected for histological analysis, 
      enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry, 16S rRNA sequencing, and 
      metabolomic profiling. RESULTS: IF significantly affected body weight and 
      intestinal morphology, compromised the intestinal barrier, increased 
      pro-inflammatory cytokines, and heightened gut immune activation (P < 0.05). It 
      also disrupted the gut microbiota, promoting pro-inflammatory bacteria, reducing 
      anti-inflammatory metabolites, and elevating pro-inflammatory metabolites (P < 
      0.05). Indoleacrylic acid (IAA) supplementation notably alleviated intestinal 
      inflammation and reversed immune dysfunction induced by IF (P < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: Prolonged IF exacerbates intestinal inflammation by impairing gut 
      barrier integrity and disrupting microbial homeostasis. However, IAA 
      supplementation effectively mitigates fasting-induced intestinal inflammation and 
      immune imbalance, suggesting its potential as a therapeutic agent.

AB  - Neurodegenerative diseases affect up to 349.2 million individuals worldwide. 
      Preclinical and clinical advances have documented that altered energy homeostasis 
      and mitochondria dysfunction is a hallmark of neurological disorders. 
      Diet-derived ceramides species might target and disrupt mitochondria function 
      leading to defective energy balance and neurodegeneration. Ceramides as bioactive 
      lipid species affect mitochondria function by several mechanism including changes 
      in membrane chemical composition, inhibition of the respiratory chain, ROS 
      overproduction and oxidative stress, and also by activating mitophagy. Promising 
      avenues of intervention has documented that intermittent fasting (IF) is able to 
      benefit and set proper energy metabolism. IF is an eating protocol that involves 
      alternating periods of fasting with periods of eating which modulate ceramide 
      metabolism and mitochondria function in neurons. This review will address the 
      detrimental effect of ceramides on mitochondria membrane composition, respiratory 
      chain, ROS dynamics and mitophagy in brain contributing to neurodegeneration. We 
      will focus on effect of IF on ceramide metabolism as a potential avenue to 
      improve mitochondria function and prevention of neurodegeneration.

TI  - Visceral adiposity loss is associated with improvement in cardiometabolic 
      markers: findings from a dietary intervention study.
PG  - 1576599

LID - 1576599
AB  - BACKGROUND: Visceral adiposity is closely linked with cardiometabolic disorders, 
      but evidence on the extent of visceral fat loss required for significant 
      improvement in cardiometabolic markers remains limited. This study aims to 
      investigate the association between visceral fat area (VFA) reductions and 
      improvements in cardiometabolic markers following a 3-month dietary intervention. 
      METHODS: A total of 175 adults with overweight and obesity were involved in this 
      non-randomized controlled trial. Data on sociodemographic, anthropometric, body 
      composition and biochemistry were collected at baseline and after 3 months of 
      intervention. The multiple logistic regression analysis was conducted to 
      determine the association between VFA loss (no loss, < 5% loss, and >/= 5% loss) 
      and improvement in cardiometabolic markers. For each cardiometabolic marker, an 
      improvement surpassing the minimum threshold of the third tertile was classified 
      as a good improvement. RESULTS: Compared to those with no VFA loss, participants 
      with VFA loss of >/= 5% were significantly associated with a higher improvement in 
      waist circumference (OR 2.97, 95% CI 1.16-7.64), high-density lipoprotein 
      cholesterol (HDL-C) (OR 4.19, 95% CI 1.58-11.14), triglycerides (OR 3.01, 95% CI 
      1.14-7.92), and glycated hemoglobin (HbA1C) (OR 2.95, 95% CI 1.12-7.79). Other 
      than that, those with < 5% VFA loss were 3.6 times more likely to have a higher 
      improvement in HDL-C compared to those with no VFA loss (OR 4.08, 95% CI 
      1.36-12.22). CONCLUSION: This study found that the magnitude of VFA loss is an 
      independent determinant of improvements in cardiometabolic markers and should be 
      set as a clear target when designing obesity prevention programs.

TI  - Additional Effect of Exercise to Intermittent Fasting on Body Composition and 
      Cardiometabolic Health in Adults With Overweight/obesity: A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-analysis.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study is to evaluate the additional effect of 
      exercise to intermittent fasting (IF) on body composition and cardiometabolic 
      health in adults with overweight/obesity. METHOD: Relevant studies were 
      identified through a systematic search across five databases. A random-effects 
      meta-analysis was conducted on outcomes including body composition and 
      cardiometabolic health markers, to compare the effect of combining IF with 
      exercise against IF alone. The certainty of the evidence was evaluated using the 
      GRADE approach, while the quality of the included studies was assessed using the 
      revised Cochrane risk-of-bias tool and the TESTEX scale. RESULT: In total, twelve 
      studies including 616 participants (Age: 40 +/- 9 years; BMI: 33.6 +/- 4.8 kg/m(2); 
      87.3% female) were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. The 
      combined intervention was more effective, leading to greater reductions in fat 
      mass (-0.93 kg [95% CI: -1.69, -0.18]) and waist circumference (-2.51 cm [95% CI: 
      -3.70, -1.32]) when compared to IF alone. Cardiometabolic health parameters also 
      showed greater improvements, with decreased insulin (-3.1uIU/ml [95%CI: -4.25; 
      -1.95]), HOMA-IR (-0.57 [95%CI: -0.83; -0.31]), LDL (-10.67 mg/dl [95%CI: -20; 
      -1.35]), resting heart rate (-2.68 bpm [95%CI: -4.71; -0.64]), along with 
      enhanced cardiorespiratory fitness (VO(2 max):1.92 ml/kg/min [95%CI: 0.32; 
      3.52]). For the remaining outcome variables, no statistically meaningful 
      differences emerged between the groups. CONCLUSION: The potential benefits of 
      incorporating exercise into IF for adults with overweight/obesity, particularly 
      in terms of body composition, glycemic control, and cardiorespiratory fitness, 
      appear promising. Nevertheless, given the limited amount of data, future 
      investigations are essential to strengthen the evidence base and investigate the 
      influence of specific exercise and IF types in enhancing treatment outcomes.

TI  - Intermittent fasting strategies and their effects on body weight and other 
      cardiometabolic risk factors: systematic review and network meta-analysis of 
      randomised clinical trials.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the effect of intermittent fasting diets, with continuous 
      energy restriction or unrestricted (ad-libitum) diets on intermediate 
      cardiometabolic outcomes from randomised clinical trials. DESIGN: Systematic 
      review and network meta-analysis. DATA SOURCES: Medline, Embase, and central 
      databases from inception to 14 November 2024. ELIGIBILITY CRITERIA FOR SELECTING 
      STUDIES: Randomised clinical trials comparing the association of intermittent 
      fasting diets (alternate day fasting, time restricted eating, and whole day 
      fasting), continuous energy restriction, and ad-libitum diets were included. MAIN 
      OUTCOMES: Outcomes included body weight (primary) and measures of anthropometry, 
      glucose metabolism, lipid profiles, blood pressure, C-reactive protein, and 
      markers of liver disease. DATA SYNTHESIS: A network meta-analysis based on a 
      frequentist framework was performed with data expressed as mean difference with 
      95% confidence intervals (CIs). The certainty of the evidence was assessed using 
      grading of recommendations assessment, development, and evaluation (GRADE). 
      RESULTS: 99 randomised clinical trials involving 6582 adults of varying health 
      conditions (720 healthy, 5862 existing health conditions) were identified. All 
      intermittent fasting and continuous energy restriction diet strategies reduced 
      body weight when compared with ad-libitum diet. Compared with continuous energy 
      restriction, alternate day fasting was the only form of intermittent fasting diet 
      strategy to show benefit in body weight reduction (mean difference -1.29 kg (95% 
      CI -1.99 to -0.59), moderate certainty of evidence). Additionally, alternate day 
      fasting showed a trivial reduction in body weight compared with both time 
      restricted eating and whole day fasting (mean difference -1.69 kg (-2.49 to 
      -0.88) and -1.05 kg (-1.90 to -0.19), respectively, both with moderate certainty 
      of evidence). Estimates were similar among trials with less than 24 weeks 
      follow-up (n=76); however, moderate-to-long-term trials (>/=24 weeks, n=17) only 
      showed benefits in weight reduction in diet strategies compared with ad-libitum. 
      Furthermore, in comparisons between intermittent fasting strategies, alternate 
      day fasting lowered total cholesterol, triglycerides, and non-high density 
      lipoprotein compared with time restricted eating. Compared with whole day 
      fasting, however, time restricted eating resulted in a small increase in total 
      cholesterol, low density lipoprotein cholesterol, and non-high density 
      lipoprotein cholesterol. No differences were noted between intermittent fasting, 
      continuous energy restriction, and ad-libitum diets for HbA(1c) and high density 
      lipoprotein. CONCLUSIONS: Minor differences were noted between some intermittent 
      fasting diets and continuous energy restriction, with some benefit of weight loss 
      with alternate day fasting in shorter duration trials. The current evidence 
      provides some indication that intermittent fasting diets have similar benefits to 
      continuous energy restriction for weight loss and cardiometabolic risk factors. 
      Longer duration trials are needed to further substantiate these findings. TRIAL

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cognitive decline and sleep concerns are significant health issues 
      among older adults. Nonpharmacological treatments to address these concerns are 
      needed, particularly for older adults who are more likely to be prescribed 
      multiple medications and experience adverse effects of additional drugs. The aim 
      of the current qualitative study was to understand and document the experiences 
      of older adults with subjective memory decline participating in prolonged nightly 
      fasting (PNF) intervention. METHODS: This single-group pilot study was conducted 
      as a fully remote, 8-week, pre/postintervention. Postintervention, 16 
      participants (>/=65 years) participated in semistructured qualitative exit 
      interviews about their experiences with the PNF intervention. Interviews lasted 
      approximately 20-30 minutes, were conducted by trained study staff, and then 
      analyzed by the team to understand relevant themes. RESULTS: Two major themes 
      that emerged from the data were engagement with and perceived effects of the PNF 
      intervention. Within these two themes, nine subthemes emerged: accountability; 
      use of days off; feasibility; intervention tools; behavioral strategies; 
      timing/routine; awareness; self-efficacy; and perceived health-related outcomes. 
      Overall, interviews suggested strong engagement with the PNF intervention as well 
      as a number of positive perceived effects of the intervention. CONCLUSIONS: These 
      findings contribute to a broad field of intermittent fasting by exploring and 
      understanding the direct experiences of older adults participating in PNF. Some 
      participants identified challenges of participation, yet this qualitative 
      approach can guide future PNF implementation with older adults. Notably, 
      responses support the quantitative data suggesting that PNF is a feasible and 
      acceptable intervention for older adults.

AB  - BACKGROUND: It is hypothesized that the presence of microorganisms in the gut is 
      reflected in circulating blood through small DNA fragments resulting from the 
      degradation of these organisms. Cross-sectional studies have not yet provided a 
      definitive answer regarding the validity of this hypothesis, and the potential 
      presence of a so-called common blood-microbiome remains highly controversial. 
      Both bioinformatical pipelines (which may produce false-positive results) and 
      environmental contamination may obscure the less than 5 % microbial DNA that is 
      postulated to be present within the total blood DNA. METHOD/DESIGN: This study 
      aims to validate the existence of the blood microbiome using one month of 
      intermittent fasting (OMIF). Through a prospective, randomized, controlled 
      cross-over trial, we will evaluate the effect of OMIF on the composition and 
      function of the blood microbiome in healthy volunteers, with secondary outcomes 
      on clarifying the relationship between the gut and blood microbiome. Healthy 
      volunteers aged 18-65 will be enrolled. All volunteers will undergo OMIF, a 
      washout period and an ad libitum diet for another month, with the order of the 
      interventions assigned randomly. We will assess the dynamics in blood microbiome 
      in response to OMIF versus those seen during an ad libitum diet, using shotgun 
      sequencing. Physiological changes will be monitored A dietary recall interview 
      will be conducted during the trial to evaluate energy intake, and movement data 
      collected from Health App will be used to assess changes in physical activity. 
      CONCLUSION: If successful, this trial provides a proof-of-concept study 
      documenting the existence of a bona fide blood microbiome. CLINICAL TRIAL

AB  - BACKGROUND: Highly caloric food consumed around the clock perturbs the metabolism 
      and cognitive functioning. We hypothesised that obesogenic food could alter 
      neuronal representations of memory depending on the feeding-fasting cycle. 
      METHODS: We tracked memory performance, dendritic spine dynamics and neuronal 
      representations of memory in C57Bl6J mice fed obesogenic food ad libitum from 
      peri-adolescence. We aimed to correct energy rich diet-induced plasticity 
      deficits and cognitive impairment with time-restricted feeding in males and 
      females. We further used chemogenetics, pharmacology and knock-in mice to 
      investigate functional correlates underlying diet-induced neurocognitive 
      impairments. FINDINGS: We found that changes in the feeding-fasting cycle 
      reverted the effects of ad libitum obesogenic food on memory impairment in both 
      sexes (n = 55, p = 0.003). Concurrently, it also corrected the increased 
      dendritic spine maintenance and neuroactivity in hippocampus and the decreased 
      spine maintenance and activity in parietal cortex (n = 48, p < 0.005). 
      Bi-directional effects in cortex and hippocampus mediated by glucocorticoid 
      signalling are causal to behavioural changes (n = 91, p = 0.0008), and scaling 
      hippocampal with cortical activities restored memory in mice fed obesogenic food 
      (n = 44, p = 0.02). INTERPRETATION: These results indicate that meal scheduling 
      is a promising approach to confront glucocorticoid signalling bias and memory 
      deficits caused by obesogenic food. FUNDING: Agence Nationale de la Recherche

TI  - Evidence-based review of the nutritional treatment of obesity and metabolic 
      dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease in children and adolescents.
LID - 10.1002/jpn3.70099 [doi]
AB  - The growing pediatric obesity epidemic has paralleled the surge in metabolic 
      dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) and metabolic 
      dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis. It develops due to nutritional 
      imbalances, microbiome dysbiosis, gene regulation, hormonal changes, and 
      environmental factors like food deserts, low activity level, and an unhealthy 
      lifestyle. The prevalence of MASLD and obesity is rising every year. Lifestyle 
      changes remain the mainstay treatment for obesity and MASLD. Per the 2023 
      American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases Practice Guidance on MASLD, 
      achieving >/=5% weight loss can reduce hepatic steatosis, >/=7% weight loss can 
      reduce hepatic inflammation, and >/=10% weight loss can reduce liver fibrosis. 
      Therefore, nutritional interventions can be a powerful tool to help correct 
      metabolic dysfunction and promote healthy weight loss. Current endorsed 
      nutritional interventions for weight loss or MASLD include the Mediterranean 
      diet, low glycemic/low carbohydrate diet, plant-based diet/anti-inflammatory 
      diet, ketogenic diet, and intermittent fasting. This review provides 
      evidence-based insights into current nutritional interventions for children and 
      adolescents with obesity and MASLD to help guide pediatric gastroenterologists in 
      making the best dietary-based recommendations in clinical practice.

TI  - Role of Fasting in the Management of Non-alcoholic Fatty Liver Disease (NAFLD): A 
      Systematic Review of Clinical Trials.

AB  - Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) is one of the leading causes of chronic 
      liver disease. Lifestyle changes, especially dietary, have been recognized as 
      important measures for managing the condition. This systematic review aimed at 
      assessing the effectiveness of fasting protocols, including time-restricted 
      feeding (TRF), alternate-day fasting (ADF), the 5:2 diet, and other lifestyle 
      interventions in enhancing metabolic and hepatic profiles. The search for 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) was extended to include PubMed, Scopus, 
      ScienceDirect, and Google Scholar for articles published between 2019 and 2024. 
      The studies that included participants with fatty liver disease and examined the 
      effects of fasting on hepatic steatosis, metabolic markers, and liver enzymes 
      were included, and the quality of the studies was evaluated using the Cochrane 
      risk of bias tool. Out of the 12 RCTs that were included in the study, there was 
      a significant reduction in hepatic steatosis, an increase in insulin sensitivity, 
      and a decrease in inflammatory markers. TRF and ADF were found to be effective 
      forms of calorie restriction, as they were well tolerated by the patients. The 
      combination of ADF with aerobic exercise and TRF with low-sugar diets was seen to 
      have potent effects on the liver and other metabolic parameters. However, certain 
      drawbacks include the variation in the fasting protocols, small subject numbers, 
      and brief follow-up periods. The current study highlights that intermittent 
      fasting is a viable non-pharmacological option for the management of NAFLD with a 
      focus on the timing and content of eating periods. The following are needed to 
      strengthen the evidence and to guide the clinicians in its application: 
      standardized fasting protocols and long-term trials.

AB  - Subcellular disorders are linked with several diseases, specifically 
      mitochondrial dysfunction linked to age, metabolic disorders, cancer, 
      cardiovascular disease, and other mitochondrial diseases (MDs). Intracellular 
      medication delivery is a promising option for effective therapy. This study aims 
      to highlight subcellular delivery with focus on mitochondrial pharmacology, gene 
      therapy, transplantation, and drug targeting. PubMed, Google Scholar, Scopus, and 
      other scholarly sources were leveraged to prepare this narrative review. 
      According to current studies, intermittent fasting, consistent exercise, 
      well-balanced diets, and proper sleep can all help to increase mitochondrial 
      quality. Molecular therapies improve mitochondrial bioenergetics, redox status, 
      biogenesis, dynamics, mitophagy, bioenergetic, and sirtuins. The antioxidant 
      supplementation restores endogenous antioxidants such as alpha-lipoic acid, 
      tocopherols, L-carnitine, and coenzyme Q10 to prevent mitochondrial damage. 
      Mdivi-1, melatonin, resveratrol, PGC-1alpha agonists, metformin, and Opa1 activators 
      modify the dynamics and biogenesis of mitochondria. Bioactive phytochemicals, 
      including curcumin, berberine, quercetin, and capsaicin, affect OXPHOS and 
      mitochondrial sirtuins. These agents affect gene expression, antioxidant 
      defenses, inflammation, and mitochondrion functions. Therefore, bioactive 
      phytochemicals limit oxidative damage, increase insulin sensitivity, and improve 
      extended cell longevity. Mitochondrial transplantation and gene therapy using 
      mRNA and gene editing technologies are promising treatment options for MDs. 
      Mitoquidone, triphenylphosphine, mitochondrial-targeting peptides, and 
      nanocarriers localize medicines within mitochondrial compartments. In conclusion, 
      a good lifestyle and bioactive materials, alongside mitochondrial medications, 
      gene therapy, transplantation, and drug targeting, could restore overall cellular 
      health.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Ramadan fasting constitutes a form of intermittent fasting, and it 
      is a religious obligation for healthy adult Muslims; however, there is a lack of 
      comprehensive guidance for individuals diagnosed with sickle cell disease (SCD). 
      This study seeks to identify predictors of fasting capability and investigate the 
      effects of fasting among this patient population. PARTICIPANTS AND METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional study enrolled adult Muslim patients with SCD from Saudi Arabia. 
      Data were collected through direct interviews using a structured questionnaire 
      with four sections. RESULTS: A total of 320 patients with SCD were evaluated, 
      with a mean age of 32.6 years (SD +/- 11.01) and the majority were females (63.1%). 
      Among these participants, 214 (66.9%) observed Ramadan intermittent fasting (RIF) 
      while 106 (33.1%) did not observe the fasting month or had interrupted fasting. 
      Participants having secondary and university education were nearly twice as 
      likely to fast the entire Ramadan (p = 0.025 and p = 0.003, respectively). 
      History of SCD crises, emergency visits, acute chest syndrome, and intensive care 
      unit admission were all significantly associated with lower odds of fasting the 
      entire month (OR = 0.25, p = 0.019; OR = 0.25, p = 0.001; OR = 0.57, p = 0.035; 
      and OR = 0.46, p = 0.003, respectively). Participants with more than four SCD 
      episodes or more than four emergency room visits had significantly higher odds of 
      experiencing complications within 30 days following Ramadan (OR = 3.31, p < 0.001 
      and OR = 2.55, p = 0.004, respectively). CONCLUSION: The effects of observing RIF 
      on individuals with SCD are generally subtle during the month but more 
      significant in the post-fasting phase. The capacity to predict an individual's 
      ability to fast and likelihood of post-fasting complications is substantially 
      influenced by a range of sociodemographic factors such as education level as well 
      as clinical variables, including frequency of annual hospitalizations, emergency 
      room visits, intensive care unit admissions, occurrences of acute chest syndrome, 
      and the presence of thrombocytosis. A Comprehensive evaluation of these factors 
      will provide enhanced guidance for medical practitioners, facilitating more 
      informed and insightful decisions regarding patient fasting recommendations.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Intermittent fasting is an emerging dietary approach, 
      but its specific role in colorectal cancer (CRC) is not yet clear. In this study, 
      we investigated the relationship between intermittent fasting and colorectal 
      development in mice. METHODS: First, APC (Min/+) mouse models (a spontaneous 
      model of colorectal cancer) were subjected to intermittent fasting intervention 
      (2 days/week) with regular monitoring of body weight changes. Subsequently, 16S 
      rRNA sequencing and untargeted metabolomics were employed to analyze alterations 
      in fecal microbial community structure and metabolic profiles following the 
      fasting intervention. Tumor development was quantitatively assessed by 
      enumerating CRC lesions using HE staining, while histopathological evaluation was 
      performed to determine the degree of neoplastic progression. Concurrently, 
      western blotting was conducted to examine the expression levels of intestinal 
      barrier function-related proteins. Finally, in vitro validation experiments, 
      including colony formation assay and transwell invasion assay, were performed to 
      investigate the effects of the key microbial metabolite isovaleric acid on the 
      proliferative and invasive capacities of CRC cells. RESULTS: Intermittent fasting 
      significantly reduced tumor incidence by approximately 50% compared to the 
      control group (1.25 +/- 0.38 vs 2.50 +/- 0.38 tumors/mouse, P = 0.017) and markedly 
      attenuated tumor progression. 16S rRNA sequencing analysis revealed significant 
      enrichment of two key bacterial genera, Alistipes (P = 0.030) and Odoribacter (P 
      = 0.030), along with a significant reduction in fecal isovaleric acid levels (P < 
      0.05) in the intermittent fasting group. Furthermore, intermittent fasting 
      effectively controlled body weight gain (P < 0.05) and significantly improved 
      intestinal barrier function (P < 0.05). In vitro experiments further demonstrated 
      that isovaleric acid directly promoted CRC cell proliferation (P < 0.05) and 
      enhanced their invasive capacity (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Intermittent fasting 
      suppresses CRC development in mice through its effects on gut microbiota and 
      related metabolites.

TI  - Comparing exercise modalities during caloric restriction: a systematic review and 
      network meta-analysis on body composition.
PG  - 1579024

AB  - BACKGROUND: In recent years, caloric restriction (CR), intermittent fasting (IF), 
      and the ketogenic diet (KD) have gained popularity as primary dietary 
      interventions for improving body composition. While these approaches offer 
      benefits, both IF and KD have been associated with various adverse effects. 
      Although CR is generally devoid of significant side effects, it may lead to 
      reductions in lean body mass. To mitigate this, CR combined with exercise 
      (CR + EX) has become a preferred strategy for maintaining overall health. 
      However, under CR conditions, the effects of exercise may differ from those 
      observed with a normal diet. Most existing studies compare CR + EX with CR alone, 
      exercise alone, or a control (CON) group. Although prior studies have examined 
      caloric restriction with exercise, direct comparisons between specific exercise 
      modalities in a caloric deficit remain unclear, necessitating a network 
      meta-analysis approach. This study summarizes the literature on CR combined with 
      exercise to identify which exercise regimen, when paired with CR, yields the most 
      favorable outcomes. The findings will provide valuable recommendations for 
      individuals seeking to maintain or improve body composition through CR + EX. 
      METHODS: A systematic review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA 
      guidelines, covering literature from the inception of databases up to September 
      2024. Searches were performed in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and the Cochrane 
      Library. This study was registered in PROSPERO under the identifier: 
      CRD42024588241. Only randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving healthy 
      populations were included. Articles were rigorously screened according to the 
      PICOS strategy (methods) eligibility criteria, and the risk of bias was assessed 
      using the Cochrane Risk of Bias Tool. A network meta-analysis was performed, and 
      the intervention effects were ranked using the Surface Under the Cumulative 
      Ranking (SUCRA) curve. RESULTS: The network meta-analysis included 62 RCTs, 
      encompassing 4,429 participants. The ranking of intervention effects is as 
      follows: Weight reduction: high-intensity aerobic exercise 
      (HA) > moderate-intensity aerobic exercise (MA) > low-intensity aerobic exercise 
      (LA) > moderate-intensity mixed exercise (MM) > high-intensity mixed exercise 
      (HM) > CR > low-intensity resistance exercise (LR) > moderate-intensity 
      resistance exercise (MR) > high-intensity resistance exercise (HR) > Control 
      group (CON), Compared to CON, the effect sizes for the other groups were as 
      follows: HA: 7.94 (6.34, 9.55), MA: 7.78 (5.97, 9.58), LA: 7.10 (5.10, 9.10), MM: 
      6.65 (3.49, 9.81), HM: 7.47 (3.19, 11.75), CR: 7.10 (5.10, 9.10), LR: 5.45 (0.17, 
      10.72), MR: 5.62 (3.17, 8.06), HR: 6.00 (3.24, 8.76); BMI reduction: 
      LA > MM > HA > MA > HR > CR > HM > MR > CON; Fat mass reduction: 
      LA > HA > HM > MA > MR > LR > HR > CR > MM > CON, Compared to CON, the effect 
      sizes for the other groups were as follows: LA: 2.70 (1.76, 3.65), MM: 3.35 
      (1.94, 4.75), HA: 2.90 (2.11, 3.70), MA: 2.96 (2.09, 3.84), HR: 2.56 (1.43, 
      3.69), CR: 2.47 (1.79, 3.15), HM: 1.73 (-0.34, 3.81), MR: 2.26 (1.08, 3.45); Body 
      fat percentage reduction: HA > MM > LR > HR > MR > HM > MA > LA > CR > CON, 
      Compared to CON, the effect sizes for the other groups were as follows: HA: 4.80

      MM > MR > LR > HR > MA > LA > HM > HA > CR, Compared to CON, the effect sizes of 
      the other groups were as follows: MM: 0.14 (-2.91, 3.19), MR: 0.03 (-2.24, 2.29), 
      LR: 0.36 (-4.15, 4.87), HR: -0.17 (-2.36, 2.02), MA: -0.40 (-2.22, 1.43), LA: 
      -0.58 (-2.75, 1.59), HM: -0.81 (-4.27, 2.65), HA: -0.67 (-2.33, 0.98), CR: -1.66 
      (-3.12, -0.19). In summary, LR + CR, MA + CR and MR + CR are at an advantageous 
      level in improving various indicators. CONCLUSION: Combining moderate-and 
      low-intensity resistance or aerobic exercise with caloric restriction optimizes 
      fat loss while preserving lean body mass, making it a superior strategy for body 
      composition improvement. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION: This study was 
      registered in PROSPERO under the identifier: CRD42024588241.

TI  - Altered Ramadan fasting glycemic profiles of adults with type 1 diabetes reveal 
      strong evidence of underestimated insulin adjustments: a 3-year observational 
      study in Arab settings.
PG  - 1399990

AB  - BACKGROUND: Adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) who fast during Ramadan remain a 
      severely understudied population in terms of changes in glycemic control, making 
      evidence-based recommendations for insulin adjustments difficult in this 
      age-group. To fill this gap, we aimed to prospectively observe the changes in 
      glycemic control of young adults with T1D who fast during Ramadan. METHODS: In 
      this 3-year prospective study, we enrolled participants with T1D with flash 
      glucose monitoring (FGM) data during the Ramadan periods of 2020-2022. CGM data 
      for 4 weeks before, during, and after Ramadan were collected and analyzed. A 
      sub-cohort of age-matched non-DM participants (N=49) who fasted during the 
      Ramadan of 2022 were included for comparison. RESULTS: A total of 76 participants 
      were enrolled, of whom only 39 (19 males and 20 females, mean age 28.1 +/- 8.4 
      years) completed the three-year follow-up. The mean duration of diabetes among 
      these participants was 11.5 +/- 8.9 years. Ten (26%) patients were on insulin pump, 
      and 22 (56%) patients received Ramadan-focused education at baseline. Pooled 
      glycemic trends during Ramadan showed two main abnormal glucose spikes: after 
      Iftar (between 16:00-18:00 and 18:00-20:00), with a difference of 15.5mg/dL, and 
      after Suhoor (between 0:00-2:00h to 4:00-6:00), with a difference of 18.8mg/dL. 
      These abnormal glycemic indices persisted a month after Ramadan. In parallel, 
      these glucose spikes were also observed in non-DM participants, but remained 
      within normal limits. CONCLUSIONS: Ramadan fasting among adults with T1D in SA is 
      associated with deterioration in glycemic control, with the highest glucose 
      spikes observed after Iftar and Suhoor. These hyperglycemic episodes were most 
      prominent during Ramadan and persisted for at least a month after. The present 
      real-time evidence warrants the need to review insulin adjustments in this 
      understudied group, focusing on high risk patients with T1D, including those with 
      history of overindulgent behavior during Ramadan.

TI  - From Soil to Brain: Olive Oil Attributes, Consumer Choices, Intermittent Fasting, 
      and Their Impact on Health.
LID - 10.3390/nu17111905 [doi]
LID - 1905
AB  - Olive oil (OO) has longstanding significance in human history, particularly in 
      the Mediterranean region, where it has been a cornerstone of diet, economy, and 
      culture. This history adds to modern evidence-based knowledge. Background: The 
      Mediterranean diet (MD), rich in plant-based foods and OO, has been extensively 
      associated with improved cardiometabolic and cognitive health. Recent interest 
      has emerged in understanding how intermittent fasting protocols may enhance these 
      effects. Still, the quality of OO does not only lie in the extraction process; it 
      is also dependent on the tree variety, the soil, and the agricultural practices, 
      ending with the way in which the finished product is stored and consumed. 
      Objectives: This review explores the synergistic potential between OO consumption 
      and intermittent fasting, focusing on their combined impact on metabolic health, 
      oxidative stress, and inflammatory pathways. Methods: A literature search was 
      conducted using multiple databases to identify studies addressing the health 
      effects of OO, fasting, and the MD. Both human and relevant preclinical studies 
      were considered, with emphasis on those evaluating inflammatory markers, lipid 
      metabolism, insulin sensitivity, and neuroprotective mechanisms. Results: 
      Evidence suggests that the bioactive compounds in EVOO may potentiate the 
      benefits of fasting by enhancing antioxidant capacity, reducing postprandial 
      inflammation, and modulating gene expression related to cellular metabolism. 
      Combined, these factors may support improved insulin sensitivity, reduced 
      oxidative damage, and delayed onset of age-related diseases. Conclusions: 
      Understanding the integrative role of OO and fasting within the MD framework 
      could offer valuable insights for nutritional strategies aimed at preventing 
      metabolic syndrome, type 2 diabetes, and neurodegeneration. These findings also 
      support the need for future clinical trials exploring the timing, dosage, and 
      dietary context in which these interventions are most effective.

TI  - Low Carbohydrate Diet Containing Soy Protein and Fish Oil Reduces AOM/DSS-Induced 
      Colon Cancer, in Part, by an Acetate-Mediated Reduction in T(H)17 Cell 
      Differentiation.
PG  - e70113
LID - 10.1002/mnfr.70113 [doi]
AB  - Since our previous studies found a low-carbohydrate (CHO) diet containing soy 
      protein and fish oil (i.e., 15%Amylose/Soy/FO) significantly reduced tobacco 
      carcinogen-induced lung nodules in A/J mice, breast tumors in C3(1)/Tag mice, and 
      myelomalignancy in miR-146a knockout mice, we asked herein if this CHO diet could 
      also reduce colorectal cancer. We tested the efficacy of the 15%Amylose/Soy/FO 
      diet in preventing colitis-induced colorectal cancer using an 
      azoxymethane/dextran sodium sulfate BALB/c mouse model. The 15%Amylose/Soy/FO 
      diet significantly reduced colon tumor numbers compared to a Western diet and 
      this was associated with a reduction in blood glucose, and a trend towards an 
      increase in plasma beta-hydroxybutyrate and an increase in liver fatty acid 
      synthase, suggesting a systemic metabolic shift from glucose to fatty acids as an 
      energy source. In addition, our CHO diet reduced proinflammatory cytokines, 
      induced a marked change in the fecal microbiome, an increase in cecal and fecal 
      acetate, and a reduction in interleukin-17A expressing cells in the colonic 
      tumors of mice on the 15%Amylose/Soy/FO diet. Taken together, our results suggest 
      the 15%Amylose/Soy/FO diet ameliorates colitis and prevents the subsequent 
      development of colorectal cancer, in part by an acetate-mediated reduction in 
      T(H)17 cell development.

TI  - Spermidine supplementation and protein restriction protect from organismal and 
      brain aging independently.
LID - 10.18632/aging.206267 [doi]
AB  - Brain aging and cognitive decline are significant biomedical and societal 
      concerns. Both dietary restriction, such as limiting protein intake, and fasting, 
      which restricts the timing of food consumption, have been proposed as strategies 
      to delay aspects of aging. Recent studies suggest that intermittent fasting 
      effects are mediated by the endogenous polyamine spermidine. Spermidine 
      supplementation promotes mitochondrial integrity and functionality in aging 
      brains by supporting hypusination of the translational initiation factor eIF5A. 
      However, how molecular mechanisms underlying fasting mimicking interventions and 
      protein restriction converge remain unclear, yet biomedically relevant. In this 
      study, we combined low- and high-protein diets (2% versus 12% yeast in food) with 
      spermidine supplementation in aging Drosophila fruit flies. Effective 
      hypusination was essential for normal life expectancy on both 2% and 12% yeast 
      diets. Spermidine supplementation increased longevity, protected against 
      age-related locomotion decline on both diets and improved memory scores in older 
      flies regardless of protein intake. Notably, spermidine did not reduce the 
      positive effects of the 12% protein diet on fecundity. Our findings suggest that 
      while both protein restriction and spermidine supplementation improve brain 
      mitochondrial function, they largely operate through distinct mechanisms in 
      modulating Drosophila brain aging. These results offer a basis for potential 
      synergistic lifestyle interventions targeting age-related brain decline.

AB  - Ramadan is a month-long religious festival and observed globally by Muslims, 
      characterised by intermittent fasting, prayer, reflection and a focus on 
      community. Fasting is one of the five pillars of Islam and has well documented 
      positive impacts on physical health. An article by Bandarian et al., (2021) 
      highlighted the research gaps in Ramadan fasting studies relating to health and 
      disease. The article called for more research studies on different health and 
      disease conditions other than nutrition and metabolic disorders. The authors on 
      this correspondence article continue this call and respectfully articulate the 
      wider societal impact and benefits of Ramadan through its positive impact, 
      through embracing multicultural, multinational and multifaith communities within 
      the United Arab Emirates.

AB  - PURPOSE: We aimed to determine the associations of low-carb diets with glycated 
      haemoglobin (HbA1c) and diabetes complications among Ghanaian adults, who 
      traditionally rely on carbohydrate-dense diets and experience a high prevalence 
      of type 2 diabetes (T2DM). METHODS: This analysis used baseline data of the 
      multi-centre RODAM (Research on Obesity and Diabetes among African Migrants) 
      Study among Ghanaian adults (N = 5,898; 18-96 years) living in Ghana and Europe. 
      Energy (kcal/d) and macronutrient intakes (energy%) were computed from the 
      semi-quantitative Ghana Food Propensity Questionnaire. A low-carb diet score 
      (0-30 points) was calculated as the sum of 0-10 points for 11 strata of 
      carbohydrate, protein and fat intakes, respectively. For the associations with 
      ln-transformed HbA1c, we calculated multiple-adjusted beta coefficients, 95% 
      confidence intervals (CIs), and p-values by linear regressions and stratified by 
      T2DM status. Among participants with T2DM, multiple-adjusted odds ratios (OR), 
      95% CIs, and p-values were computed by logistic regression for the associations 
      of the low-carb diet score with microvascular and macrovascular complications. 
      RESULTS: Neither macronutrient intakes nor the low-carb diet score were 
      associated with ln (HbA1c) among individuals with T2DM. Among individuals without 
      T2DM, the corresponding associations were statistically significant with marginal 
      beta coefficients between|0.01| and|0.04|. Regarding diabetes complications, we 
      observed an inverse association of the low-carb diet score with self-reported 
      stroke (adjusted OR: 0.95; 95% CI: 0.91, 0.99). CONCLUSION: Using a low-carb diet 
      score, our results from this Ghanaian study population do neither support the 
      hypothesis that low-carb diets improve blood glucose control, nor that low-carb 
      diets are associated with diabetes complications.

AB  - PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This research aims to elucidate the molecular mechanisms by 
      which intermittent fasting (IF) induces autophagy and to evaluate its therapeutic 
      potential across a range of pathologies. By synthesizing findings from 
      preclinical and clinical studies, the review seeks to clarify the roles of key 
      signaling pathways-such as the AMPK-mTOR axis, sirtuins, and 
      beta-hydroxybutyrate-mediated signaling-in orchestrating autophagic processes, 
      thereby enhancing cellular resilience and metabolic homeostasis. RECENT FINDINGS: 
      Recent evidence demonstrates that IF robustly activates autophagy in 
      metabolically active tissues through conserved molecular pathways. Experimental 
      studies reveal that fasting increases AMPK phosphorylation and inhibits mTOR 
      activity, leading to enhanced expression of autophagy markers like LC3-II, 
      Beclin-1, and ATG proteins. Additionally, IF has been shown to improve insulin 
      sensitivity, reduce hepatic lipid accumulation, and mitigate neurodegenerative 
      processes by promoting the clearance of toxic protein aggregates. Emerging 
      clinical data further support these findings, indicating that tailored fasting 
      protocols can modulate autophagy to yield benefits in metabolic, oncological, and 
      neurodegenerative disorders. The scoped literature underscores IF as a promising 
      non-pharmacological strategy to induce autophagy and improve overall health. 
      While robust preclinical and clinical evidence supports its beneficial effects, 
      challenges remain in standardizing fasting protocols and identifying optimal 
      biomarkers for monitoring autophagic activity. Future research should focus on 
      long-term, well-controlled trials and combined therapeutic approaches to refine 
      IF strategies, ultimately translating these insights into personalized dietary 
      interventions for disease prevention and health optimization.

AB  - Intermittent fasting (IF) is increasingly recognized as an effective dietary 
      intervention for slowing aging process and alleviating metabolic disturbances in 
      multiple chronic diseases, especially in cardiovascular diseases (CVDs). Despite 
      recent progress, the mechanisms behind its effects on cardiovascular health from 
      the perspective of circadian rhythms are not yet fully understood. This review 
      aims to explore the interaction between IF and circadian rhythms, focusing on 
      their combined effects on cardiometabolic risks and cardiovascular outcomes. 
      Evidence from animal models and clinical trials suggests that IF provides 
      protective effects against cardiac damage and dysfunction. It is also indicated 
      that IF influences key cardiometabolic risk factors, such as insulin sensitivity, 
      inflammation, and lipid metabolism, by aligning with the intrinsic biological 
      rhythms. Additionally, we discuss the therapeutic potential of IF in 
      cardiovascular outcomes, particularly in individuals with circadian disruptions. 
      This review also highlights future research directions to identify the most 
      effective fasting protocols and assess the long-term cardiovascular benefits of 
      IF in disease prevention and treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To assess the Effects of Ramadan fasting during third trimester on 
      Doppler indices, non-stress test and perinatal outcomes. METHODS: This 
      prospective, cross-sectional research was carried out in the Department of 
      Obstetrics and Gynaecology unit 1, Dr Ruth KM Pfau Civil Hospital Karachi from 
      March 2024 to May 2024. The study involved 100 participants they were divided 
      into two groups, fasting group with minimum 10 days of fasting (Group-I) and 
      non-fasting group (Group-II). Umbilical artery systolic/diastolic ratio, 
      pulsatility index, middle cerebral artery pulsatility index and amniotic fluid 
      index was measured during third trimester. This was followed by for non-stress 
      test (cardiotocography) for about 30 minutes. Both groups were followed till 
      delivery. At delivery placental weight, baby birth weight, head circumference, 
      length and mid arm circumference of baby were recorded. RESULTS: A total of 100 
      pregnant women were included. 52% (n=26) observed continuous fasting and 48% 
      (n=24) observed intermittent fasting. Overall median age and BMI of pregnant 
      women were 27 (IQR: 23-30) years and 25 (IQR: 24-29) kg/m(2), respectively. 
      Amniotic fluid index was a bit higher in women who were not fasting (Median: 
      13.7, IQR: 11.0-15.0) as compared to those who fasted during pregnancy (Median: 
      12.3, IQR: 10.7-15.0). Although Doppler assessment and CTG findings did not show 
      any significant association with the fasting status of pregnant women except 
      median pulsatility index which was significantly higher in non-fasted group (1.0, 
      IQR: 0.9-1.4 vs. 0.9, IQR: 0.7-1.1, p-value=0.002). Overall median weight of baby 
      and Apgar score at 5-min were 3.0 (IQR: 2.8-3.2) kg and 8 (IQR: 8-10), 
      respectively. The anthropometric measurements were similar in both groups. 
      CONCLUSION: Maternal fasting during Ramadan does not adversely affect Doppler 
      indices, amniotic fluid index, non-stress test and fetal condition.

TI  - Ramadan Fasting Improves Health-Related Quality of Life in Patients With 
      Secondary Adrenal Insufficiency: A Prospective Interventional Case-Control Study.
LID - 10.1111/cen.15286 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Intermittent fasting (IF) exposes patients with adrenal 
      insufficiency (AI) to complications related to undertreatment. We aimed to 
      determine the effect of IF during Ramadan on the quality of life of patients with 
      secondary adrenal insufficiency (SAI) compared to healthy controls. SUBJECTS AND 
      METHODS: It is a prospective case-control study conducted at the Department of 
      Endocrinology of La Rabta University Hospital in Tunisia. Fifty patients with SAI 
      and 100 age-, sex- and body mass index-matched controls were enrolled and 
      followed up throughout Ramadan 2023. All participants answered the Addison's 
      disease quality of life questionnaire (AddiQoL) before Ramadan and during the 
      third week of fasting. RESULTS: There were 33 women and 17 men, median age: 43 
      years (IQR: 34-55), median duration of SAI: 7.5 years (IQR: 4-12.5), treated with 
      hydrocortisone at a median dose of 0.24 mg/kg/day (IQR: 0.20-0.27). Before 
      Ramadan, there was no significant difference between patients and controls in the 
      global AddiQoL score, fatigue score, and emotional sphere score (89 vs. 93, 
      p = 0.196; 24 vs. 24, p = 0.354, and 24 vs. 25, p = 0.536, respectively). The 
      score of AI symptoms was altered in patients (27 vs. 30, p = 0.021). During 
      fasting, the global AddiQoL score (8.2% vs. 0%, p = 0.005), the fatigue score (8% 
      vs. -1.7%, p = 0.003), the emotional sphere score (4.2% vs. 0%, p = 0.009), and 
      the AI symptoms' score (9.1% vs. 0%, p = 0.017) improved in patients compared to 
      controls. CONCLUSION: Ramadan fasting improved the quality of life in SAI 
      patients by reducing fatigue, emotional stress, and AI symptoms. TRIAL

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Non-communicable chronic diseases are on the rise globally, 
      and diet plays a crucial role. Intermittent fasting (IF), particularly 
      time-restricted eating (TRE), has emerged as a potential strategy to manage these 
      conditions. Research suggests that TRE, combined with healthy diets like the 
      Mediterranean diet, may benefit populations, including older adults. METHODS AND 
      RESULTS: Seventeen adults over 60 years of age were randomly assigned to the 
      TRE + MED group (n = 8), following a 12-h fast with the Mediterranean diet, or 
      the MED-DIET group (n = 9), following the diet without fasting. Over three 
      months, changes in anthropometric, biochemical, and quality of life measures were 
      assessed. The TRE + MED group showed significant reductions in BMI (p = 0.040), 
      waist circumference (p < 0.001), hip circumference (p = 0.025), waist-to-hip 
      ratio (p = 0.023), and systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p = 0.020), along with 
      changes in fasting glucose. In the MED-DIET group, only SBP decreased 
      significantly (p = 0.022). Between-group comparisons showed greater improvements 
      in waist circumference (p = 0.001) and waist-to-hip ratio (WHR; p = 0.036) in the 
      TRE + MED group. Conversely, gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) levels improved 
      more in the MED-DIET group (p = 0.020). However, in the between-group comparison, 
      only the reduction in waist circumference, WHR, and GGT levels reached 
      statistical significance. Both groups improved Mediterranean diet adherence, 
      quality of life, and stool regularity, but only 20 % of the TRE + MED group was 
      willing to continue fasting, compared to 100 % in the MED-DIET group. CONCLUSION: 
      TRE combined with the Mediterranean diet offers superior health benefits compared 
      to the Mediterranean diet alone. In addition, adhering to a consistent meal 
      schedule and regulating meal timing appear to be more challenging for the studied 
      population.

TI  - The experiences of night shift workers following three different dietary weight 
      loss interventions: a qualitative study using behaviour change theory.
PG  - 64
LID - 10.1186/s12966-025-01750-7 [doi]
LID - 64
AB  - BACKGROUND: Shift workers are an estimated 15%-30% of the workforce in developed 
      countries, who are disproportionally at risk of living with overweight or 
      obesity. Dietary guidance is a component recommended for obesity management, 
      however lacks consideration of the lifestyle and circadian disruption experienced 
      by night shift workers. There is a lack of evidence addressing both weight loss 
      and the metabolic consequences of eating at night. Intermittent fasting (IF) may 
      provide metabolic benefits if fasting is aligned with night shifts. The Shifting 
      Weight using Intermittent Fasting in night shift workers study compares three 
      weight-loss interventions: 1) continuous energy restriction (CER); or 
      twice-per-week IF with 2) fasting during night shifts or 3) day fasting. This 
      study aims to explore the experiences of participants while following the 
      interventions to understand how intervention features and external enablers or 
      barriers influence engagement. METHODS: Forty-seven semi-structured interviews 
      (22 baseline, 25 follow-up) were conducted with 33 participants. Eighteen 
      participants also completed optional fortnightly audio diaries to enrich data 
      collected on experiences over time. Interviews and diaries were analysed using 
      the five-steps of framework analysis and themes were deductively mapped to 
      behaviour change frameworks and the social-ecological model. RESULTS: Analysis 
      resulted in seven major themes and 27 subthemes. Three main themes describe 
      intervention factors influencing engagement: 1) Simplicity and ease, 2) Support 
      and accountability, and 3) An individualised approach is sometimes needed. Four 
      themes described external factors to the interventions influencing engagement: 4) 
      Personal motivation and attitudes, 5) Physiological influences of eating 
      behaviours, 6) Social support at home and work, and 7) Work structure and 
      environment. CONCLUSIONS: Across all three interventions, participants valued the 
      ease of interventions, which was the clear dietary prescription and focus on two 
      days per week for IF, or a focus on small changes for CER. Behavioural regulation 
      and providing meals/snacks were identified as critical features. Modifications to 
      address identified enablers/barriers include: providing flexible fasting periods; 
      addition of fatigue management initiatives; increased focus on non-weight related 
      health changes during periods of slowed weight-loss; implementation in workplace 
      settings to harness social support; and providing a healthier food environment.

TI  - Regulation of Metabolic Aging Through Adenosine Mono Phosphate-Activated Protein 
      Kinase and Mammalian Target of Rapamycin: A Comparative Study of Intermittent 
      Fasting Variations in Obese Young Women.
LID - 10.3390/nu17101695 [doi]
LID - 1695
AB  - Background/Objectives: Obesity accelerates metabolic aging through oxidative 
      stress, inflammation, and mitochondrial dysfunction. AMP-activated protein kinase 
      (AMPK) and mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) are nutrient-sensing pathways 
      regulating metabolism. AMPK promotes energy metabolism and autophagy, while 
      excessive mTOR activity contributes to aging. Intermittent fasting (IF), 
      including time-restricted feeding (TRF)-limiting food intake to a 6 h window 
      (18:6)-and alternate-day modified fasting (ADMF)-alternating 24 h fasting (</=25% 
      daily caloric intake) with unrestricted feeding-may improve metabolic regulation. 
      However, their effects on AMPK, mTOR, and metabolic age remain unclear. Methods: 
      This quasi-experimental pre-test-post-test control group study compared the TRF 
      and ADMF on metabolic age, AMPK, and mTOR in young obese women. Twenty-four 
      participants (mean age: 21.29 +/- 1.76 years; body fat: 36.92 +/- 3.18%; BMI: 29.68 +/- 
      3.70 kg/m(2)) were initially matched by BMI and assigned to Control, TRF, and 
      ADMF groups. A total of 4 participants (1 Control, 3 ADMF) were excluded due to 
      outlier values, yielding final group sizes: Control (n = 7), TRF (n = 8), and 
      ADMF (n = 5). The intervention lasted 20 days. Results: A significant decrease in 
      AMPK levels was observed in the ADMF group (p = 0.043), while changes in the TRF 
      and Control groups were not significant. mTOR levels showed a decreasing trend 
      but were not statistically significant. No significant changes were found in 
      metabolic age. Conclusions: Twenty days of intermittent fasting intervention did 
      not significantly affect AMPK, mTOR, or metabolic age in young obese women. TRF 
      may more effectively enhance AMPK and reduce mTOR, while ADMF may better reduce 
      metabolic age.

LID - 10.3390/nu17101689 [doi]
LID - 1689
AB  - Background/Objectives: Shift workers face higher risks of impaired glucose 
      metabolism due to irregular eating habits and circadian misalignment. 
      Time-restricted eating (TRE) could improve glucose metabolism by aligning food 
      intake with the circadian clock, but its effectiveness remains unclear. Methods: 
      Ten electronic databases (PubMed, EMBASE, Cochrane Library, CINAHL, PsycINFO, 
      Scopus, Web of Science, ProQuest Dissertations and Theses, Science.gov, and 
      ClinicalTrials.gov) were searched from journal inception to September 2024. Only 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) involving shift workers were included. 
      Meta-analyses with sensitivity analyses were conducted using a random-effects 
      model to pool glucose metabolism and sleep outcomes, with heterogeneity and 
      quality assessments performed. Results: Six RCTs were included. TRE demonstrated 
      positive but non-significant effects on glucose metabolism outcomes: fasting 
      blood glucose (weighted mean difference [WMD]: -0.02 mmol/L, 95% confidence 
      interval [CI]: -0.13 to 0.10, I(2) = 0%), fasting blood insulin (WMD: -5.77 
      pmol/L, 95% CI: -85.62 to 74.08, I(2) = 92%), HOMA-IR (WMD: -0.50, 95% CI: -2.76 
      to 1.76, I(2) = 82%), 2 h postprandial glucose (WMD: -0.65 mmol/L, 95% CI: -3.18 
      to 1.89, I(2) = 86%), total sleep time (g = 0.07, 95% CI: -0.23 to 0.37, I(2) = 
      0%), and sleep efficiency (g = -0.05, 95% CI: -0.63 to 0.53, I(2) = 62%). 
      Sensitivity analyses yielded similar findings, and overall certainty of evidence 
      was rated 'very low'. Conclusions: While TRE shows potential for improving the 
      glucose metabolism in shift workers, current evidence remains inconclusive due to 
      small sample sizes and study limitations. Future research should prioritize 
      well-powered TRE RCTs in shift workers that adhere to a 6-10 h eating window. 
      Incorporating early-TRE schedules with sleep hygiene may optimize metabolic 
      outcomes, with circadian biomarkers analyzed to better elucidate the mechanistic 
      pathway implicated.

TI  - Predictors of Vitamin D Status in Religious and Intermittent Fasting: A 
      Comparative Study in Orthodox Nuns and Women from the General Population.
LID - 10.3390/nu17101656 [doi]
LID - 1656
AB  - Background: Vitamin D plays a key role in bone metabolism and immune regulation. 
      Populations with restricted sun exposure or limited dietary intake are 
      particularly vulnerable to vitamin D deficiency. Orthodox Christian nuns 
      represent a unique group in this regard, due to traditional clothing, limited 
      outdoor activity, and prolonged religious fasting. However, few studies have 
      compared them with lay individuals following similar dietary practices. 
      Objective: This study aimed to investigate predictors of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin 
      D [25(OH)D] concentrations in two female populations: Orthodox Christian nuns and 
      women from the general population practicing intermittent (religious or 
      non-religious) fasting. We also aimed to develop predictive models of vitamin D 
      status for each group based on lifestyle and biochemical parameters. Methods: A 
      total of 85 women (40 Orthodox nuns and 45 laywomen), aged 30-50 years, were 
      enrolled. Serum 25(OH)D, parathyroid hormone (PTH), calcium levels, and 
      anthropometric indices, including body mass index (BMI), total body fat, and 
      visceral fat, were measured. Dietary calcium and vitamin D intake, as well as sun 
      exposure, were assessed using validated questionnaires. Separate stepwise 
      multiple regression models were constructed for each group to identify 
      independent predictors of 25(OH)D concentrations. An additional combined model, 
      including all participants, was also explored. Results: PTH was the most 
      significant predictor, negatively correlating with 25(OH)D concentrations in both 
      groups (p = 0.038), highlighting its regulatory role in vitamin D metabolism. 
      When analyzed separately, the model for Orthodox nuns showed stronger explanatory 
      power (adjusted R(2) = 0.718; p = 0.013) compared with the control group 
      (adjusted R(2) = 0.362; p = 0.038), with PTH emerging as a key predictor in both. 
      Conclusions: Distinct predictors of vitamin D status were identified in each 
      group, reflecting the complex interplay between lifestyle and physiological 
      factors. These findings suggest that targeted interventions, such as addressing 
      PTH regulation in fasting populations or enhancing sun exposure in the general 
      population, may be more effective in preventing vitamin D deficiency depending on 
      the context.

TI  - Integrative Strategies for Preventing and Managing Metabolic Syndrome: The Impact 
      of Exercise and Diet on Oxidative Stress Reduction-A Review.
LID - 10.3390/life15050757 [doi]
LID - 757
AB  - Metabolic syndrome (MetS) is characterized by central obesity, insulin 
      resistance, hypertension, dyslipidemia, and chronic inflammation, significantly 
      increasing the risk of cardiovascular disease and type 2 diabetes. Effective 
      management of MetS is critical, with exercise being a key intervention. This 
      review analyzed the effects of different exercise intensities-low, moderate, and 
      high-intensity interval training (HIIT)-on metabolic health, oxidative stress 
      (OS), inflammation, and cardiovascular function. A search of Medline, PEDro, and 
      EBSCO identified 2251 articles, with 159 studies published between 1999 and 2025 
      included after screening. Low-intensity exercise improved insulin sensitivity, 
      reduced OS markers (e.g., MDA, 8-OHdG), and enhanced antioxidant enzyme activity. 
      Moderate-intensity exercise showed similar benefits with notable reductions in 
      inflammatory markers (e.g., IL-1beta, TNF-alpha). HIIT promoted fat loss and improved 
      metabolic markers but temporarily increased OS and inflammation. Dietary 
      strategies also play a critical role. The Mediterranean diet and Dietary 
      Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) diets are well established, emphasizing 
      nutrient-dense foods like unsaturated fats and fiber to reduce inflammation and 
      manage weight. The ketogenic diet (KD), a high-fat, low-carbohydrate approach, 
      has recently gained attention for its metabolic benefits. KD induces ketosis, 
      improving insulin sensitivity, reducing triglycerides, and enhancing fat 
      oxidation. Studies show KD effectively reduces body weight and glucose levels, 
      though long-term adherence and nutrient deficiencies remain challenges. 
      Intermittent fasting also showed potential benefits, though effects on glucose 
      metabolism were inconsistent. This review underscores the need for tailored 
      approaches combining exercise, diet, and fasting to optimize MetS outcomes, 
      offering integrative strategies for prevention and management.

TI  - Effects of Intermittent Fasting on Liver Steatosis and Fibrosis, Serum FGF-21 and 
      Autophagy Markers in Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Fatty Liver Disease: A 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/life15050696 [doi]
LID - 696
AB  - BACKGROUND: This randomized controlled study sought to determine the effect of 
      intermittent fasting on anthropometric measurements, fibroblast growth factor 
      (FGF)-21, and autophagy markers, as well as on hepatic steatosis and fibrosis 
      levels in overweight or obese patients with metabolic dysfunction-associated 
      fatty liver disease (MAFLD). METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned into two 
      groups: received a dietary treatment involving 22-25 kcal/kg/day of energy for 8 
      weeks and followed the same dietary intervention and a 16:8 pattern. The extent 
      of hepatic steatosis and fibrosis was determined using transient elastography on 
      a FibroScan((R)) device. The controlled attenuation parameter (CAP) and liver 
      stiffness measurement (LSM), determined by transient elastography, reflect 
      hepatic steatosis and fibrosis, respectively. In duplicate, serum levels of 
      FGF-21, Beclin-1, and ATG-5 were determined using enzyme-linked immunosorbent 
      assay. RESULTS: The study included 48 patients with a mean age of 48.2 +/- 1.4 
      years (27 female and 21 male). Improvements in anthropometric measurement and CAP 
      and LSM levels and a decrease in serum FGF-21 levels were found in both groups (p 
      < 0.05). Changes in the CAP and FGF-21 levels were higher in the energy + 
      time-restricted diet group (p < 0.05). Autophagy-related protein (ATG)-5 levels 
      increased only in the energy + time-restricted diet group [(0.74 (0.46-1.29) 
      ng/mL vs. 0.95 (0.73-1.32) ng/mL, p = 0.03]. CONCLUSIONS: Intermittent fasting 
      was potentially practical in the management of MAFLD. In particular, changes in 
      FGF-21 and ATG-5 levels indicate the potential of intermittent fasting to 
      regulate metabolic processes and autophagy. However, methodological limitations 
      should be taken into consideration when interpreting the study results.

AB  - Intermittent fasting (IF) is a dietary approach that influences key metabolic 
      pathways, including autophagy-a crucial mechanism in maintaining cellular 
      homeostasis. Autophagy plays a dual role in oncogenesis, acting both as a tumor 
      suppressor and a survival mechanism under metabolic stress. IF has shown 
      potential for reducing cancer risk and enhancing therapeutic efficacy by 
      sensitizing tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. However, its effects 
      depend heavily on the type and stage of cancer. Potential risks, such as 
      excessive weight loss and malnutrition, require careful evaluation. Further 
      clinical studies are needed to optimize IF protocols as adjuncts to cancer 
      therapy. This review discusses autophagy mechanisms induced by IF, their 
      therapeutic implications in oncology, and the limitations of this dietary 
      strategy.

TI  - Acrolein-Triggered Ferroptosis and Protection by Intermittent Fasting via the 
      AMPK/NRF2-CLOCK/BMAL1 Pathway.
LID - 10.3390/toxics13050369 [doi]
LID - 369
AB  - Environmental pollution significantly exacerbates various diseases, particularly 
      those affecting the cardiovascular and respiratory systems. Our previous studies 
      have shown that acrolein, an environmental pollutant, promotes atherosclerosis by 
      downregulating the circadian clock genes (CLOCK/BMAL1) and disrupting circadian 
      rhythm. We have also found that intermittent fasting (IF), closely linked to the 
      circadian clock, may mitigate atherosclerosis induced by acrolein. Ferroptosis, a 
      newly identified form of regulated cell death, is associated with the 
      acceleration of atherosclerotic development, but its relationship with the 
      circadian clock is not well understood. In this study, we explored the potential 
      of IF to alleviate ferroptosis by modulating the circadian clock. Our in vivo 
      experiments revealed that IF reversed ferroptosis and upregulated CLOCK/BMAL1 in 
      APOE-/- mice. In human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs), we discovered 
      that acrolein-induced ferroptosis leads to cell death, while short-term 
      starvation (STS, IF cell model) reversed this effect. Acrolein also suppressed 
      the expression of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), nuclear factor erythroid 
      2-related factor 2 (NRF2), and CLOCK/BMAL1, which were restored by subsequent STS 
      treatments. Additionally, the overexpression of CLOCK/BMAL1 mitigated 
      ferroptosis, consistent with findings from CLOCK gene knockout experiments. 
      Notably, CLOCK/BMAL1 and AMPK/NRF2 were found to be mutually regulated. 
      Concurrently, the AMPK and NRF2 signaling pathways may be interdependent and act 
      in concert. In conclusion, our findings suggest that IF modulates the 
      CLOCK/BMAL1-AMPK/NRF2 pathway to alleviate acrolein-induced ferroptosis, offering 
      a potential strategy to address health issues related to environmental pollution.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study aims to investigate the prevalence of intermittent fasting 
      (IF) among Chinese residents aged 18-80 and assess its impact on physical 
      activity (PA) levels. METHODS: Data were sourced from the Psychology and Behavior 
      Investigation of Chinese Residents, a nationally representative cross-sectional 
      survey conducted between June 20 and 31 August 2022. A multistage stratified 
      cluster sampling method was used. Propensity score matching (PSM) was applied to 
      compare PA levels between individuals practicing IF and those not practicing it. 
      Multiple logistic regression and subgroup analysis were performed to explore 
      associations between PA levels and relevant factors. RESULTS: IF was practiced by 
      9.78% of participants, with the highest prevalence (70.78%) among those aged 
      18-34. While there were no significant differences in baseline characteristics 
      between the IF and non-IF groups, sleep duration differed. IF was significantly 
      associated with reduced PA levels (OR = 0.769, 95%CI: 0.657-0.900), and subgroup 
      analysis highlighted the effect of sleep patterns on PA. CONCLUSION: IF is common 
      among younger Chinese residents and correlates with lower PA levels, indicating a 
      potential need for individualized health guidance to balance dietary strategies 
      with PA.

      pancreatic steatosis: possible role of aquaporins.
PG  - 207
LID - 10.1186/s10020-025-01239-w [doi]
LID - 207
AB  - BACKGROUND: The molecular basis of pancreatic steatosis is not entirely known. 
      Aquaporins (AQPs) are integral membrane proteins involved in a variety of 
      pancreatic functions. Given the little data regarding the potential role of 
      aquaporins in the pathogenesis of pancreatic steatosis, this study was designed 
      to assess the role of aquaporins and the NLRP3-inflammasome in the rat model of 
      high-fat fructose diet (HFFD) and to investigate the impact of vitamin D 
      supplementation and alternate day fasting (ADF) in ameliorating HFFD-induced 
      pancreatic steatosis. METHOD: Twenty-four Sprague-Dawley male rats were divided 
      equally into 4 groups. Group I (control group), Group II (HFFD group), Group III 
      (HFFD + ADF group), and Group IV (HFFD + vitamin D group). By the end of the 
      experiment, fasting blood samples were collected for determination of blood 
      glucose, serum insulin, lipid profile, and insulin resistance. Oxidative stress 
      biomarkers (malondialdehyde and reduced glutathione), inflammatory markers 
      (interleukin-1beta and TNF-alpha), and expression of aquaporins (AQP-1, AQP-3, and 
      AQP-7) genes were evaluated in pancreatic tissues. Histopathological examination 
      of the pancreas and immunohistochemistry of the NLRP3-infammasome and AQP-7 were 
      performed. RESULTS: The HFFD group exhibited pancreatic steatosis with a 
      significant elevation in the levels of blood sugar, serum insulin, insulin 
      resistance, lipid profile, oxidative stress, inflammatory markers, and AQP-3 and 
      AQP-7 mRNA expressions. Regarding histopathology, there were pale 
      vacuolated-stained cytoplasm in acinar pancreatic cells and increased 
      immunoreactivity for AQP-7 and NLRP3-inflammasome. All these parameters improved 
      with ADF and vitamin D supplementation, with more favorable effects for ADF. 
      CONCLUSION: ADF and vitamin D treatment ameliorated the effect of the high-fat 
      fructose diet at both levels of the biochemical and histopathological 
      examinations.

AB  - Depression is one of the most common and debilitating mental disorders and one of 
      the main causes of disability worldwide. Despite the progress made in the 
      treatment of depression, approximately 20 %-40 % of patients with a major 
      depressive episode do not show a clinical response to current antidepressant 
      treatments. Approximately 85 % of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) 
      experience a high relapse rate after recovering from an acute episode of major 
      depression. Over the past decade, protein ubiquitination and deubiquitination 
      have attracted considerable interest. An increasing number of studies have shown 
      that ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs) play essential roles in the pathogenesis 
      of depression. USP is part of the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS), a critical 
      non-lysosomal pathway specific for protein degradation, and plays a significant 
      role in presynaptic and postsynaptic proteins crucial for regulating 
      neurotransmission and synaptic plasticity. However, its potential contribution to 
      the pathophysiology of depression has not yet been addressed in detail. 
      Therefore, this review explores the potential of targeting USP as a novel 
      approach to antidepressant treatment, focusing on the targets and mechanisms of 
      USP in the regulation of depression. By providing insights into USP in 
      preclinical research, this review aims to contribute to developing new 
      therapeutic methods for enhancing the efficacy of antidepressant treatments.

LID - 1554072
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Mental health stigma remains a significant public health concern, 
      particularly due to its complex relationship with suicide risk. While the two 
      phenomena appear to be closely connected, inconsistencies in stigma measurement 
      and a lack of standardized instruments complicate efforts to fully understand its 
      role in suicide occurrence and prevention. METHODS: We analyzed stigma measures 
      from the 2022 and 2023 Eurobarometer surveys, alongside suicide rates and 
      socio-economic indicators for 27 European Union countries. Correlational analyses 
      and hierarchical linear regression models were employed to assess the 
      relationships between stigma-associated variables and national suicide rates. 
      RESULTS: Our analysis revealed a notable decline in suicide rates between 2010 
      and 2019, with only four countries reporting increases. We found multiple 
      negative associations between suicide rates and stigma measures, notably for the 
      belief that disclosing a mental health condition would negatively impact one's 
      career. Hierarchical linear regression models supported this item as a 
      significant predictor of lower suicide rates. DISCUSSION: The findings underscore 
      the need for more systematic, theory-driven approaches to stigma assessment, as 
      inconsistencies in survey items and temporal mismatches between stigma and 
      suicide data hinder efforts to draw conclusive inferences. By employing robust 
      measurement tools and systematic surveillance of mental health attitudes on a 
      multinational scale, future research can better illuminate the complex interplay 
      between stigma and suicidal behavior, ultimately enhancing our efforts toward 
      suicide prevention.

TI  - Influence on Consultation Behavior of Pregnant and Postpartum Women in Japan: 
      Insights from a Nation-Wide Survey.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare13121422 [doi]
LID - 1422
AB  - Background: In Japan, new challenges are emerging, such as declining birth rates, 
      an increase in age at childbirth, postpartum depression, and child abuse. 
      Methods: This study examines the factors influencing maternal consultation 
      behavior at public institutions using some of the data from the Japan COVID-19 
      and Society Internet Survey (JACSIS). A total of 6227 women (1380 pregnant and 
      4847 postpartum) were analyzed through logistic regression. Results: The results 
      showed different factors influencing consultations between pregnant women and 
      postpartum women. Among pregnant women, different trends were observed between 
      primigravidae and multigravidae, indicating that primigravidae aged >/=40 years and 
      multigravidae with multiple childbirths tend to seek consultations more 
      frequently. In postpartum women, psychological distress (K6), adverse childhood 
      experiences (ACEs), and social support networks significantly influenced 
      consultation behavior. Postpartum women with extensive support networks (>/=3 
      confidants) exhibited higher consultation rates. In contrast, those with elevated 
      Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Mother-to-Infant Bonding Scale 
      (MIBS-J) scores were less likely to seek help, potentially due to mental health 
      stigma. Conclusions: This study showed that pregnant and postpartum women facing 
      physical, mental, family, or relationship issues are seeking consultations and 
      receiving thorough support. On the other hand, since some pregnant and postpartum 
      women refrained from seeking consultation, it is necessary to further consider 
      support measures that make it easier for all pregnant and postpartum women to 
      seek advice in the future.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a serious problem among college students, and chatbots 
      are a popular intervention tool. Social cues are used in chatbot design, but 
      their effectiveness in depression treatment remains to be verified. This study 
      aimed to compare the effects of chatbots with high-social-cue (HSC) versus 
      low-social-cue (LSC) designs on depressive symptoms. METHODS: An open-label 
      randomized controlled trial was conducted over 16 weeks. Eighty-four college 
      students with baseline Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9) scores >/=9 were 
      randomly assigned to either an HSC group (text + voice + animations) or LSC group 
      (text-only). Clinical outcomes, including PHQ-9, Generalized Anxiety Disorder 
      scale (GAD-7), and Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) scores, were 
      collected every 4 weeks. Secondary measures included user satisfaction (Client 
      Satisfaction Questionnaire-8, CSQ-8), therapeutic alliance (Working Alliance 
      Inventory-Short Revised, WAI-SR), and self-reported adherence. RESULTS: Baseline 
      characteristics did not differ significantly between groups. Intention-to-treat 
      analysis revealed that the HSC group achieved greater reductions in PHQ-9 
      (d = 0.63, P < 0.01) and GAD-7 (d = 0.50, P = 0.003) scores compared to the LSC 
      group. The HSC group also demonstrated higher adherence rates (d = 0.82, 
      P < 0.01), CSQ-8 (P = 0.02), and WAI-SR scores (P < 0.001). LSC group. 
      CONCLUSION: Chatbots with high-social-cue designs significantly outperformed 
      text-only versions in alleviating depression and anxiety, while enhancing 
      adherence, satisfaction, and therapeutic alliance.

TI  - Insulin resistance and poorer treatment outcomes in depression: evidence from UK 
      Biobank primary care data.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1192/bjp.2025.82 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Major depressive disorder (MDD) and insulin resistance-related 
      conditions are major contributors to global disability. Their co-occurrence 
      complicates clinical outcomes, increasing mortality and symptom severity. AIMS: 
      In this study, we investigated the association of insulin resistance-related 
      conditions and related polygenic scores (PGSs) with MDD clinical profile and 
      treatment outcomes, using primary care records from UK Biobank. METHOD: We 
      identified MDD cases and insulin resistance-related conditions, as well as 
      measures of depression treatment outcomes (e.g. resistance) from the records. 
      Clinical-demographic variables were derived from self-reports, and insulin 
      resistance-related PGSs were calculated using PRS-CS. Univariable analyses were 
      conducted to compare sociodemographic and clinical variables of MDD cases with 
      (IR+) and without (IR-) lifetime insulin resistance-related conditions. Multiple 
      regressions were performed to identify factors, including insulin 
      resistance-related PGSs, potentially associated with treatment outcomes, 
      adjusting for confounders. RESULTS: Among 30 919 MDD cases, 51.95% were IR+. 
      These had more antidepressant prescriptions and classes utilisation and longer 
      treatment duration than patients without insulin resistance-related conditions (P 
      < 0.001). IR+ participants showed distinctive depressive profiles, characterised 
      by concentration issues, loneliness and inadequacy feelings, which varied 
      according to the timing of MDD diagnosis relative to insulin resistance-related 
      conditions. After adjusting for confounders, insulin resistance-related 
      conditions (i.e. cardiovascular diseases, hypertension, non-alcoholic fatty liver 
      disease, obesity/overweight, prediabetes and type 2 diabetes mellitus) were 
      associated with antidepressant non-response/resistance and longer treatment 
      duration, particularly when MDD preceded insulin resistance-related conditions. 
      No significant PGS associations were found with antidepressant treatment 
      outcomes. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings support an integrated treatment approach, 
      prioritising both psychiatric and metabolic health, and public health strategies 
      aimed at early intervention and prevention of insulin resistance in MDD.

TI  - Skills for adolescent WELLbeing (SWELL): protocol for a preventive effectiveness 
      randomised controlled trial for young people at high-familial risk of depression 
      with treatment optimisation for parents with depression at study entry comparing 
      online group cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) with treatment as usual.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Young people (YP) whose parents have depression are at elevated 
      risk for developing depression themselves and could benefit from preventive 
      interventions. However, when parents are in a depressive episode, this reduces 
      the effects of psychological interventions for depression in YP. Moreover, 
      parental depression is often managed suboptimally in usual care. There is, 
      therefore, a case for identifying and optimising parental depression treatment to 
      enhance the effectiveness of psychological preventive interventions for 
      depression in YP. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This is a randomised controlled trial 
      (Skills for adolescent WELLbeing) to determine the effectiveness of a cognitive 
      behavioural therapy (CBT) intervention compared with usual care in increasing the 
      time to a major depressive episode in YP by 9-month follow-up (primary outcome). 
      The intervention offers a 12-week treatment-optimisation phase for parents 
      depressed at study entry, followed by randomisation of the young person to a 
      small group manualised online CBT programme facilitated by a therapist. YP 
      allocated to the intervention will receive eight weekly sessions plus three 
      monthly continuation sessions. Secondary outcomes include the number of 
      depression-free weeks, mental health symptoms and functioning. Mechanisms of 
      intervention action will be assessed with mediation analysis of quantitative data 
      and thematic analysis of qualitative interviews. Participants (parents/carers 
      with depression and their children aged 13-19 years) will be identified through 
      existing cohorts of adults with depression, from primary care through health 
      boards in Wales and England, UK, schools and advertising including via social

TI  - Designing Chatbots to Treat Depression in Youth: Qualitative Study.
PG  - e66632
LID - 10.2196/66632 [doi]
LID - e66632
AB  - BACKGROUND: Depression is a severe and prevalent mental disorder among youth that 
      requires professional care; however, various barriers hinder access to effective 
      treatments. Chatbots, one of the latest innovations in the research on digital 
      mental health interventions, have shown potential in addressing these barriers. 
      However, most studies on how to design chatbots to treat depression have focused 
      on adult populations or prevention in the general population. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aimed to investigate the problems faced by youth with depression and their 
      adaptive coping strategies, as well as attitudes, expectations, and design 
      preferences for chatbots designed to treat depression. METHODS: We conducted a 
      qualitative study, consisting of a semistructured interview and a concurrent 
      think-aloud session, in which participants interacted with a chatbot prototype 
      with 14 youth with a current or remitted depressive episode. RESULTS: The 
      participants reported a wide range of problems beyond core depressive symptoms, 
      such as interpersonal challenges, concerns about school and the future, and 
      problems with human therapists. Adaptive coping strategies varied, with most 
      seeking social support or engaging in pleasant activities. Attitudes toward 
      chatbots for depression treatment were predominantly positive, with participants 
      expressing less anxiety about using a chatbot than about seeing a human 
      therapist. Participants showed diverse and partially contradictory design 
      preferences, which included diverse dialogue topics, such as discussing daily 
      life, acute problems, and therapeutic exercises, as well as various preferences 
      for personality, language use, and personalization of the chatbot. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Our study provides a comprehensive foundation for designing chatbots that meet 
      the unique needs and design preferences of youth with depression. These findings 
      can inform the design of engaging and effective chatbots tailored to this 
      vulnerable population.

AB  - AIMS: The prevalence of overweight and obesity in people with type 1 diabetes has 
      increased significantly, presenting additional psychosocial challenges that vary 
      by gender. This study investigates the relationship between BMI and psychosocial 
      outcomes in adult men and women with type 1 diabetes. METHODS: This 
      cross-sectional analysis used data from people with type 1 diabetes in the BETTER 
      registry, stratified by gender and categorized into BMI groups (<25, 25-29.9, >/= 
      30 kg/m(2)). Psychosocial outcomes included depression, diabetes distress, and 
      stigmatization related to diabetes. One-way ANOVA assessed differences between 
      BMI groups by gender. Multivariable logistic regression then analyzed gender 
      differences within each BMI group, adjusting for age and HbA1c. RESULTS: Among 
      1028 participants (66 % women, mean BMI 26.4 +/- 5.1 kg/m(2), mean age 
      45.4 +/- 15.0 years), 460 adults (45 %) had a BMI < 25, 356 (35 %) between 25-29.9, 
      and 212 (21 %) >/= 30 kg/m(2). Women in the >/= 30 kg/m(2) group, compared to 
      the < 25 kg/m(2) group, had more symptoms of depression, more drug prescriptions 
      for depression/anxiety, and higher diabetes distress (p < 0.001 for all). In men, 
      psychosocial outcomes did not differ significantly across BMI groups. 
      Multivariable regression showed women were more likely than men to report 
      prescriptions for depression/anxiety and high diabetes distress, particularly in 
      the higher BMI groups. CONCLUSIONS: In adults living with type 1 diabetes, higher 
      BMI is associated with adverse psychosocial outcomes, particularly in women. 
      Gender-specific interventions addressing mental health, stigma, and weight 
      management could be beneficial to improve overall well-being.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Suicide rates have increased substantially among Asian American, 
      Native Hawaiian, and Pacific Islander Veterans. However, little is known about 
      the context of suicide risk or how best to tailor care for this population, 
      especially as it relates specifically to Asian American Veterans, for whom extant 
      research has been limited. We explored Asian American Veterans' lived experiences 
      with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, their perspectives regarding suicide risk 
      and prevention, and the broader context in which these occurred. METHODS: 
      Qualitative interviews were conducted in 2022-2023 with 20 Asian American 
      Veterans with histories of suicidal ideation and/or suicide attempt(s). 
      Interviews explored participants' identities and values (i.e., for context), as 
      well as their beliefs, experiences and perspectives regarding suicide prevention 
      (e.g., how suicide is discussed among Asian American Veterans, factors that might 
      cause Asian American Veterans to experience suicidal ideation, and how suicide 
      prevention initiatives can be tailored to address the needs of Asian American 
      Veterans). Interview transcripts were analyzed through inductive thematic content 
      analysis. RESULTS: We identified four themes relevant to Asian American Veterans' 
      experiences with suicidal thoughts and behaviors, perspectives on suicide risk 
      and prevention, and the context in which these occurred. First, participants 
      spoke to the ""model minority"" stereotype and pressure to convey self-discipline 
      and perfectionism and to acculturate to American or Western values, which were 
      also shaped by their own or familial immigration experiences. Second, 
      participants reflected upon their minoritized status within the U.S. military, 
      which often mirrored the sense of ""otherness"" experienced outside of their 
      military service. While participants described positive overall experiences in 
      the military, they also described experiencing racism during their military 
      service. Third, mental health stigma was salient, shaped by cultural beliefs and 
      perceived as consistent with military culture, deterring disclosure and 
      help-seeking and posing an obstacle for suicide prevention. Lastly, 
      destigmatizing mental healthcare and increasing the visibility of Asian American 
      Veterans seeking mental health services were considered paramount to suicide 
      prevention. CONCLUSION: Considerations for preventing suicide among Asian 
      American Veterans include addressing the sociocultural factors that shape mental 
      health, suicide risk, and healthcare use. In particular, findings suggest the 
      importance of addressing stereotypes about Asian Americans (e.g., model minority 
      myth), preventing behaviors that contribute to a sense of ""otherness,"" and 
      increasing the visibility of Asian American Veterans in outreach and messaging to 
      promote help-seeking.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate the Mental Health Literacy Assessment Scale 
      for assessing mental health literacy among community health workers. METHOD: A 
      total of 24 items were initially generated and refined through cognitive 
      interviews and expert evaluation. The final scale consisted of 20 items. Face 
      validity was ensured through cognitive interviews conducted in two phases with 
      community health workers and volunteers. Content validity was assured based on 
      the ratings of six experts. Cross-sectional survey was performed among 233 
      community health workers. Exploratory factor analysis using Varimax rotation was 
      performed to identify latent variables with factor loadings > 0.4. Confirmatory 
      factor analysis was employed to validate the model, using root mean square error 
      of approximation < 0.05, standardized root mean square residual < 0.08, 
      comparative fit index ⩾ 0.90, and Tucker-Lewis index ⩾ 0.90. Reliability was 
      assessed through Cronbach's alpha where alpha coefficient > 0.70 indicated 
      internal consistency. RESULTS: Exploratory factor analysis identified four 
      factors explaining 50.75% of variance explained by positive mental health 
      behaviors (21.44%), misconceptions about mental health (14.24%), symptoms of 
      mental distress (8.70%), and mental health stigma (6.37%). The confirmatory 
      factor analysis demonstrated excellent model fit, with indices such as the normed 
      Chi-square (1.31), comparative fit index (0.95), Tucker-Lewis index (0.94), and 
      root mean square error of approximation (0.03). The scale displayed strong 
      convergent and discriminant validity, with an average variance extracted > 0.43 
      and composite reliability > 0.70 for all factors. Internal consistency was 
      confirmed, with a Cronbach's alpha value of 0.78 for the overall scale. 
      CONCLUSION: The Mental Health Literacy Assessment Scale has demonstrated robust 
      psychometric properties and comprehensive coverage of mental health literacy 
      components, making it a valuable tool for both research and practical 
      applications among Community health workers in Nepal. While these findings 
      support its utility in this context, further validation is needed to establish 
      its applicability across other low- and middle-income countries to assess its 
      effectiveness in diverse cultural and geographic settings.

AB  - This study examined current mental health practices in methadone treatment in 
      Vietnam. We conducted 23 interviews with participants with methadone experiences 
      (n = 12), methadone physicians (n = 6), counselors (n = 5), and one focus group 
      with family members. Mental health issues were primarily identified through 
      casual observation, on-site support was limited, and referrals to psychiatric 
      care were rarely pursued. Four factors shaped this situation: (1) a strained 
      patient-provider relationship; (2) an inadequately trained, unstable, unmotivated 
      workforce; (3) participants' financial constraints; and (4) mental health stigma 
      and misconception. Addressing system-level factors to enforce treatment 
      guidelines and improve provider working conditions is critical to improving care 
      quality.

TI  - Prognostic Factors of Physical Function Decline Among Middle-Aged Adults With 
      HIV.
PG  - ofaf311
LID - 10.1093/ofid/ofaf311 [doi]
LID - ofaf311
AB  - BACKGROUND: Pitavastatin to REduce Physical Function Impairment and FRailty in 
      HIV (PREPARE) found small declines in physical function overall among people with 
      HIV (PWH). However, there was substantial individual variability. The purpose of 
      this prespecified exploratory analysis was to identify the PWH at greatest risk 
      for physical function decline. METHODS: Participant-specific annualized rates of 
      change on annually measured chair rise rate, gait speed, the modified Short 
      Performance Physical Battery (composite of the latter 2 plus balance time), and 
      grip strength were estimated from linear mixed-effect models. Change in 
      performance that was below the 20th percentile of the study population in >/=1 
      measure was classified as physical function decline. Associations between 
      baseline factors and physical function decline were evaluated with log-binomial 
      regression models. RESULTS: Of 569 participants (81% male, 52% White), the median 
      age (Q1-Q3) was 51 (47-55) years. Half (52%) of the participants had decline in 
      physical function. The risk of decline was higher among females (relative risk 
      [RR], 1.32; 95% CI, 1.12-1.55) and non-Whites (RR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.05-1.45) and 
      tended to increase with age (50-55 years: RR, 1.04; 95% CI, 0.86-1.26; 55+ vs 
      40-<50 years: RR, 1.17; 95% CI, 0.98-1.39). In models adjusted for age, sex, and 
      race, we found greater risk of decline among those with history of depression 
      treatment, higher body mass index (BMI), preexisting functional impairment, 
      frailty (by index), and higher baseline high-sensitivity C-reactive protein and 
      interleukin-6 levels. CONCLUSIONS: PWH with history of depression treatment, high 
      BMI, or levels of inflammation and those showing early signs of functional 
      impairment may be at higher risk of physical function decline and should be 
      targeted for early interventions to preserve physical function with aging.

AB  - Life transitions, such as adolescence, starting higher education or employment, 
      and parenthood, are universally experienced yet psychologically demanding phases 
      that can compromise mental health. While some transitions may promote positive 
      growth, many transitions can also engender significant stress, which can 
      potentially culminate in mental health difficulties and, in some unfortunate 
      instances, psychopathology, especially when individuals lack adequate support. 
      Traditional healthcare systems, already strained by increasing demands and 
      limited resources, frequently offer inflexible, diagnostic-driven pathways with 
      limited accessibility. Therefore, individuals, especially adolescents and 
      emerging adults, have turned increasingly to non-traditional sources for mental 
      health information and support. The internet, in particular, has become an 
      indispensable resource for individuals seeking support around difficult life 
      transitions, including the transition to adulthood. Multimedia content, 
      especially videos, offers unique advantages: cultural sensitivity, peer-shared 
      experiences, the ability to overcome language and literacy barriers and many more 
      which are tailored to individual needs. Innovative content strategies, such as 
      storytelling or expert interviews, can play a pivotal role in reducing the stigma 
      associated with seeking mental health help during life transitions, which may, in 
      turn, increase the likelihood for at-risk individuals to seek formal support if 
      required, and can supplement traditional care with low-threshold information. 
      However, the digital landscape is not without its inherent challenges, including 
      misinformation. While there are frameworks to evaluate and promote credible, 
      evidence-based health content online, there needs to be greater effort to ensure 
      its frictionless integration into formal clinical pathways, when appropriate. To 
      address the complex challenges and fully realize the benefits of digital media 
      mental health care during life transitions, a coordinated, multi-stakeholder 
      approach is essential: this includes collaboration between healthcare providers, 
      policymakers, researchers, technology companies and content creators. We should 
      prioritise developing culturally inclusive, engaging, evidence-based content; 
      promoting digital literacy among users and providers; and expanding access to 
      information, support, and self-management tools specifically designed for 
      individuals navigating life's transitions. Investment in research and further 
      advocacy for policies is necessary to ensure quality and sustainability of 
      content as well as equitable access for a more resilient and mentally healthy 
      society.

TI  - What if STAR*D Had Been Placebo-Controlled? A Critical Reexamination of a 
      Foundational Study in Depression Treatment.
LID - 10.1097/JCP.0000000000002025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The STAR*D trial's sequence of dose escalation, switching, and 
      augmentation strategies has served as a model for most depression treatment 
      guidelines. However, STAR*D was an open-label pragmatic trial that did not use a 
      placebo control, which complicates the assessment of its outcomes. Most STAR*D 
      treatment steps have now been studied in blinded placebo-controlled randomized 
      trials, which could validate STAR*D and support the growing use of pragmatic 
      trials in depression. METHODS: This review evaluates outcomes from randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) for the major STAR*D treatment steps: dose increase 
      after inadequate response to an antidepressant (Level 1), switching the 
      antidepressant after treatment nonresponse (Levels 2 and 3), augmenting an 
      antidepressant with bupropion or buspirone (Level 2), augmenting an 
      antidepressant with lithium or T3 thyroid hormone (Level 3), and using 
      combination mirtazapine-venlafaxine (Level 4). FINDINGS: RCTs have generally not 
      replicated the findings of STAR*D. Of the major treatment steps, there is only 
      positive evidence for lithium augmentation and alpha2-antagonist-serotonin-reuptake 
      inhibitor combination. Limitations of this review include variation in the 
      quality and quantity of comparable RCTs for each treatment level and differences 
      in the inclusion criteria of RCTs and STAR*D. CONCLUSIONS: These findings raise 
      questions about the evidence supporting widely used treatment strategies 
      following an inadequate response to an initial antidepressant. They suggest that 
      pragmatic trials should be interpreted cautiously in the absence of blinded 
      placebo-controlled studies and point to the need for high-quality blinded 
      clinical trials of second-step and third-step depression treatments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Although many instruments aiming to measure attitudes toward people 
      with borderline personality disorder (BPD) exist, most demonstrate limited 
      evidence of construct validity. AIMS: To evaluate the psychometric properties of 
      the Prejudice toward People with Borderline Personality Disorder (PPBPD) scale in 
      a sample of healthcare providers (HCPs) and expand the nomological network of 
      prejudice toward people with BPD. METHOD: A survey containing the PPBPD scale and 
      related measures was completed by 593 HCPs who provided services for people with 
      BPD. RESULTS: Confirmatory factor analysis supported the four-factor structure, 
      comprising fear/avoidance, malevolence, authoritarianism, and unpredictability. 
      Differential associations were found between the four PPBPD factors and 
      correlates, such as knowledge of BPD, belief in treatment effectiveness and 
      patient recovery, prior contact with patients who have BPD, and empathy. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The results provided evidence for the validity and psychometric 
      properties of the PPBPD in a sample of HCPs and support its utility in measuring 
      attitudes toward people with BPD. The expansion of the PPBPD's nomological 
      network improves understanding of how this prejudice may be maintained, and 
      reduced, in healthcare settings. This research will contribute to efforts in 
      developing and implementing interventions to support HCPs and reduce prejudice 
      toward people living with BPD.

AB  - Depression is a severe heterogeneous mental illness that is highly co-morbid with 
      other mental and somatic disorders. It poses a significant healthcare burden on 
      both individuals and society. Currently, the use of single-target antidepressants 
      exhibits suboptimal efficacy with significant adverse effects. Acupuncture has 
      been advocated as a practical and effective treatment for depression, due to its 
      low adverse effects rate compared to antidepressant medication. Currently, 
      several studies have shown that acupuncture treatment for depression primarily 
      involves multiple therapeutic mechanisms, including the regulation of specific 
      gene expression, neuropeptide and neurotransmitter release, increasing the 
      expression of neurotrophic factors, suppressing hyperactivity of the 
      hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, attenuating inflammatory responses, 
      and restoring gut microbiota balance. These therapeutic effects involve the 
      regulation of critical signaling pathways, including the cAMP-responsive element 
      binding protein (CREB) signaling pathway, mitogen-activated protein kinases 
      (MAPK) signaling pathway, mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling 
      pathway, and toll-like receptors (TLR) signaling pathway. Notably, 
      depression-associated molecular mechanisms and signaling pathway dysregulations 
      are closely linked to impaired neural and synaptic plasticity. Acupuncture 
      synergistically modulates the neuro-immune-microbiome multidimensional network 
      and integrates crosstalk among key pathways such as CREB, thereby systemically 
      restoring synaptic plasticity. This multi-dimensional integrative mechanism 
      likely underlies its therapeutic superiority over single-target antidepressants. 
      This review aims to elucidate how acupuncture restores cerebral synaptic 
      plasticity by rectifying depression-related systemic dysfunctions and signaling 
      pathway abnormalities, which will advance our understanding of its regulatory 
      potential in depression treatment and inform the development of precision 
      therapeutic strategies.

AB  - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a widespread systemic pain disorder often accompanied by 
      symptoms such as insomnia, mania, obesity, and depression. FM is difficult to 
      diagnose and, therefore, cannot be effectively treated with current medical 
      approaches. After prolonged suffering, FM patients frequently seek help from 
      chronic pain physicians and psychiatrists. Eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA), derived 
      from fish oil, is a common nutritional therapy for pain. While EPA is a 
      documented fatty acid for depression treatment, its role in FM management is less 
      established. In this study, we investigated the effects of EPA on FM pain and its 
      potential mechanisms involving microglia/astrocytes and toll-like receptor 4 
      (TLR4) pathways in the cerebellum of mice. We found that intermittent cold stress 
      (ICS) effectively induced FM-like pain in mice. Pain was evaluated using von Frey 
      and Hargraves' tests to assess mechanical (2.01 +/- 0.11 g) and thermal 
      (4.09 +/- 0.34 s) sensitivity. Nociceptive responses were alleviated by oral EPA 
      administration (3.68 +/- 0.13 g and 7.89 +/- 0.3 s). EPA levels were lower in FM mice 
      but increased following oral intake. Our findings revealed elevated levels of 
      microglia/astrocyte markers and neurotransmitters such as HMGB1 and S100B in the 
      cerebellum 5-7 (CB5-7) of FM mice. Similarly, TLR4 and related nociceptive 
      signals were upregulated in the FM group. Notably, oral EPA effectively reduced 
      these pain-related substances in CB5-7. Our results suggest that EPA can treat FM 
      by modulating microglia/astrocyte activity and TLR4 signaling, highlighting its 
      potential as a therapeutic target in FM management.

TI  - Characterizing Therapy Experiences in Youth With Depression and Suicide Via the 
      Depression Treatment Experiences Questionnaire.
PG  - e70088
LID - 10.1002/cpp.70088 [doi]
AB  - Depression and suicidality are prevalent mental health issues among adolescents 
      in the United States. There are multiple evidence-based practices (EBPs) for 
      depression and/or suicidality, including cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT), 
      dialectical behavioural therapy (DBT) and interpersonal therapy for adolescents 
      (IPT-A), though youth seeking psychotherapeutic treatment in community settings 
      may not consistently receive these EBPs. This study aims to characterize therapy 
      experiences among youth aged 8-20 years with depression and/or suicidal behaviour 
      who were in treatment using the Depression Treatment Experiences Questionnaire 
      (DTEQ), as well as to provide initial construct validity and test-retest 
      reliability of this new measure. Of the first 1000 participants in the Texas 
      Youth Depression and Suicide Research Network (TX-YDSRN), 585 were currently 
      receiving psychotherapy for their depression and/or suicidality. Almost half of 
      the participants engaged in therapy reported receiving some form of CBT (n = 237, 
      42.4%). The DTEQ showed a two-factor structure, including a 12-item 
      'Evidence-Based Practice' factor that demonstrated strong internal consistency 
      and test-retest reliability and a two-item 'Parental Involvement' factor that 
      showed acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Participants 
      receiving psychotherapy generally endorsed being exposed to techniques aligned 
      with EBPs. Additional non-therapeutic elements, such as exercise (n = 276, 47.1%) 
      and changing sleep habits (n = 191, 32.6%), were frequently endorsed as being 
      received by participants in psychotherapy. These results describe the therapy 
      experiences of youth engaged in psychotherapy for depression and/or suicidality 
      and propose a new assessment tool that can be used to characterize these 
      experiences. KEY PRACTITIONER MESSAGES: Youth in psychotherapy for depression or 
      suicidality frequently engage in evidence-based techniques (e.g., 
      problem-solving, cognitive restructuring), yet nearly half are unaware of the 
      type of therapy they are receiving-highlighting a gap in patient-provider 
      communication and psychoeducation. The DTEQ is a promising tool for assessing 
      therapy content and structure and may help practitioners assess that 
      evidence-based components are being implemented and understood by clients. Many 
      adolescents supplement treatment with lifestyle changes like exercise and sleep 
      adjustments-indicating the importance of integrating behavioural health 
      recommendations into therapy for holistic care.

TI  - Developing a Decision Support Tool to Guide Shared Decision-Making in Bipolar 
      Depression Treatment: Results From a Collaboration Between Clinicians and People 
      With Lived Experience.
LID - 10.1111/bdi.70037 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To build consensus from different stakeholders on the content and 
      digital interactivity of a shared decision making (SDM) tool to guide 
      patient-clinician collaborative conversations about treatment for bipolar 
      depression. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This study was conducted between September 2022 
      and September 2023. In the first phase, we conducted a narrative review on 
      pharmacological, neuromodulatory, and psychotherapeutic treatments available for 
      bipolar depression. For each option, we assessed treatment effectiveness, side 
      effects, need for clinical monitoring, clinical considerations, and cost. In the 
      second phase, committees comprised of mental health clinicians and people with 
      lived experience with bipolar disorder from a national mood disorders advocacy 
      group identified key features and content to be included in the SDM tool. A 
      thematic analysis of these data then contributed to populate the SDM tool. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-one evidence-based treatment options identified from the 
      narrative review were presented to the four convened committees (clinical, lived 
      experience, peer council, and integrated steering committees) in five meetings. 
      After discussions and thematic analysis, 12 outcomes of interest for each of the 
      therapeutic interventions were delineated for inclusion in a web-based SDM tool. 
      A detailed description of the development process and SDM tool is provided. 
      CONCLUSION: This is the first partnership between clinicians and persons with 
      bipolar disorder lived experience charged with the development of a 
      patient-centered SDM tool to integrate clinical evidence with real-world clinical 
      practice and patient preferences for use during clinical encounters. 
      Human-centered design and testing in real clinical encounters will now contribute 
      to refining the instrument and readying it for rigorous evaluation and 
      implementation in practice.

TI  - Dynamics of depression symptoms in adolescents during three types of 
      psychotherapy and post-treatment follow-up.
LID - 10.1111/jcpp.14175 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: According to the network theory of mental disorders, psychopathology 
      emerges from symptoms that causally influence one another and create 
      interconnections and feedback loops that maintain atypical mental states. 
      Analysis of symptom networks during and following psychotherapy may provide clues 
      to some of the mechanisms through which change occurs. Youth with depression are 
      an important population in which to better understand psychotherapy mechanisms 
      because current evidence-based interventions for this population show only modest 
      effects. METHODS: Participants were adolescents with major depressive disorder 
      (N = 465; ages 11-17; 75% female) in a randomized controlled trial comparing 
      cognitive behavioral therapy, short-term psychoanalytical psychotherapy, and 
      brief psychosocial intervention (IMPACT, ISRCTN83033550). Eleven self-reported 
      depression symptoms were used to compute two longitudinal networks: (1) treatment 
      phase, using baseline, 6 and 12 weeks data; and (2) follow-up phase, using 36, 
      52, and 86 weeks data. RESULTS: During the treatment phase, all depression 
      symptoms were interconnected. Symptoms of insomnia and fatigue showed the highest 
      outstrength centrality (ability to predict other symptoms over time). In 
      contrast, few symptoms were interconnected during the post-treatment phase except 
      worthlessness, which had the highest outstrength centrality. Allowing network 
      parameters to differ across the three treatment types improved model fit during 
      the treatment phase and revealed that symptoms with the highest outstrength 
      centrality varied by treatment type. CONCLUSIONS: Individual symptoms may make 
      key contributions to subsequent depressive psychopathology in adolescents. 
      Longitudinal network analysis reveals that insomnia and fatigue predict other 
      symptoms, allowing for consideration of specific mechanisms associated with 
      depression treatment. The findings further suggest that negative cognitions about 
      the self may emerge as a central putative cognitive vulnerability in those with a 
      history of depression. Our exploratory findings also suggest that the three 
      therapies (cognitive behavioral therapy, short-term psychoanalytical 
      psychotherapy, and brief psychosocial intervention) may have achieved 
      equifinality in part through different mechanisms.

AB  - African migrants living in Western countries often report experiencing high 
      levels of stress, trauma and mental health conditions due to migration-related 
      challenges, including racial discrimination, social exclusion and economic 
      hardships. This mixed-method study that sought to explore to This mixed-method 
      study explored the help-seeking behaviours of Africans in Australia. The 
      quantitative study engaged 167 participants, who completed an online survey, and 
      the qualitative aspect involved an in-depth interview with 12 participants. This 
      paper reports on the qualitative aspect of the study, which was seen as essential 
      to gaining deep, rich insights into the everyday meaning-making processes of how 
      African migrants in Australia understand and interact with mental health 
      services. Thematic analysis of the qualitative data revealed two strong recurring 
      themes on mental health stigma among African migrants in Australia. The findings 
      are discussed in two main themes: (1) judgment, shame and isolation (both 
      communal and internalised) and (2) 'madness' tropes of mental health. The study 
      highlights the critical need for culturally sensitive educational programs to 
      address stigma and enhance mental health understanding within migrant 
      communities, emphasising the importance of health professionals' awareness of 
      cultural dimensions of mental health to improve support and access to mental 
      health services for this community.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: Depressive disorders are common in the primary care setting. Despite 
      its high prevalence, depression treatment in primary care is less 
      guideline-oriented compared to specialized settings, which often makes it less 
      efficient. Current research has focused on explanations on the practitioner's 
      side but has neglected the patient's perspective and its effect on treatment 
      largely. METHODS: We conducted a scoping review on the electronic databases 
      Medline and Psycinfo. Eligible publications contained information of the 
      patients' perspective on depression treatment in primary care in OECD member 
      states. Publications until August 2nd 2023 were considered. RESULTS: After the 
      removal of duplicates, the search yielded 14.059 articles, of which 232 were 
      included. Current literature focuses on behavioral and obvious measures like 
      satisfaction, and on patient-sided barriers and facilitators to adherence. Other 
      treatment-related behaviors are less researched. Patients with undiagnosed 
      depression often report exclusively or mainly physical symptoms in general 
      practice. CONCLUSION: This review provides a comprehensive framework for the 
      concept. Research on barriers and facilitators to depression treatment in primary 
      care is still inconclusive. Educating patients and addressing stigmatizing 
      beliefs are promising targets to promote the seeking out, initiation of, and 
      adherence to treatment. Being aware of a hidden depression when somatic symptoms 
      are present, can help to detect more cases. REGISTRATION: This review is

TI  - Optimizing Treatment for Depression in Primary Care Using Psychotherapy Versus 
      Antidepressant Medication in a Low-Resource Setting: Protocol for the OptimizeD 
      Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - rs.3.rs-6716211 [pii]
LID - 10.21203/rs.3.rs-6716211/v1 [doi]
AB  - Background: Psychotherapy and antidepressant medications are first-line 
      treatments for depression, and they both have significant treatment effects on 
      average. However, treatment response varies widely across patients, and neither 
      approach is universally effective. Identifying the most effective treatment for 
      each patient is critical everywhere, but particularly in low-resource settings 
      where access to mental health care is limited. The Optimizing Depression 
      (OptimizeD) trial aims to explore whether different patients respond differently 
      to behavioral activation therapy versus antidepressant medication and if 
      providing each patient with their optimal treatment improves outcomes in primary 
      care. Methods: We plan to randomize 1,500 patients with moderate to severe 
      depression (defined as a Patient Health Questionnaire [PHQ-9] score >/=10) from 
      primary healthcare settings in Bhopal, India, with equal allocation either to a 
      culturally adapted behavioral activation therapy delivered by trained counselors 
      (Healthy Activity Program) or to antidepressant medication (fluoxetine). 
      Treatment will last 3 months, with remission (defined as PHQ-9 score <5) at 3 
      months as the primary endpoint. Using machine learning, we will attempt to 
      develop a precision treatment rule that leverages baseline clinical, 
      psychological, cognitive, socioeconomic, and biological data to predict which 
      treatment is most likely to achieve remission for each patient. 
      Cost-effectiveness analysis will then assess whether the added costs of 
      optimizing treatment are justified by improvements in remission, recovery, and 
      cost savings at the health system and societal levels. Secondary and exploratory 
      objectives include assessing the effectiveness of optimization in a range of 
      secondary outcomes, evaluating treatment mechanisms, and exploring whether 
      incorporating genetic and biological markers as predictors improves treatment 
      optimization. Discussion: The OptimizeD trial will evaluate whether baseline 
      information collected in routine care can inform optimal depression treatment 
      selection and identify predictors of nonresponse to facilitate timely specialist 
      referrals. Findings have the potential to enhance personalized depression care in 
      primary health systems, particularly in low-resource settings, with broader 
      implications for global public health. Trial registration: ClinicalTrials.gov

      pilot study.
PG  - 2434

LID - 2434
AB  - BACKGROUND: In African countries, including Zimbabwe, about half of those with 
      depression respond to first-line therapies like problem-solving therapy. 
      Predicting who needs more intensive treatment is challenging. In the US and 
      Europe, tools like the Facial Emotion Perception Test (FEPT) help match 
      treatments to likely responders. However, its applicability in Zimbabwe is 
      unexplored. AIM: To develop a racially diverse adaptation of the FEPT for 
      Shona-speaking Zimbabweans. SETTING: Outpatient primary healthcare clinics at 
      Marondera Provincial Hospital and Chitungwiza Central Hospital, Zimbabwe. 
      METHODS: Facial Emotion Perception Test was adapted using the Ecological Validity 
      Model's eight constructs through a four-step process: expert consultation, 
      preliminary content adaptation, iterative content adaptation, and finalising 
      adaptation. Three focus groups and 12 cognitive interviews assessed cultural 
      appropriateness, suitability, usability and acceptability of FEPT for Zimbabwean 
      Shona speakers. Fifteen participants, including graduates, primary healthcare 
      workers and individuals with lived experience of depression, took part. RESULTS: 
      Key adaptations of FEPT-Multiple-Races (MR)-Shona include: (1) added 20 black and 
      20 Asian face stimuli for cultural relevance; (2) improved stimuli resolution for 
      clarity; (3) extended test duration from 6 to 10 minutes for repeatable 
      tutorials; (4) provided bilingual instructions in Shona and English; (5) shifted 
      to a low-cost touchscreen tablet, familiar to Zimbabwean participants. 
      CONCLUSION: The adaptation shows promising cultural relevance and usability for 
      Shona speakers. Further testing with diverse educational and contextual 
      backgrounds is needed to enhance cross-cultural and ecological validity. 
      CONTRIBUTION: This study highlights the importance of culturally adapting 
      cognitive performance tools that can potentially improve depression treatment 
      outcomes in low-income countries.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Mental health stigma, cultural factors, high mental 
      health service costs, and knowledge about mental health are known to impact 
      mental help seeking behaviors among immigrants living in the United States 
      (U.S.). This qualitative study aimed to explore the facilitators and barriers to 
      professional mental help-seeking (PMHS) behaviors among first-generation Iranian 
      Americans (FGIAs) living in the U.S. METHOD: Twenty semi-structured in-depth 
      interviews were conducted, audio recorded, and transcribed verbatim. Data were 
      analyzed using thematic analysis via MAXQDA 2022. RESULTS: The researchers 
      identified three key themes including: 1) navigating barriers in mental health 
      services, 2) knowledge and attitudes shaping seeking professional help, and 3) 
      cultural factors and norms. In addition, several subthemes including facilitators 
      and barriers to professional mental help-seeking behaviors among Iranian 
      Americans were identified. CONCLUSIONS: Increased awareness about mental health 
      could improve the utilization of mental health services in this community. 
      Furthermore, enhancing the cultural acceptability, accessibility, and 
      approachability of mental health services are essential for efficiently 
      addressing specific needs of this population.

TI  - Applying Evidence to Improve Practice: Qualitative Insights Into Nurses' 
      Experiences With Organizational Support for Mental Health Recovery.
PG  - e70045
LID - 10.1111/wvn.70045 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: The mental health and well-being of nurses are critical issues in 
      health care, particularly following the increased stressors introduced by the 
      COVID-19 pandemic. Nurses frequently experience burnout, stress, and emotional 
      exhaustion due to systemic issues such as staffing shortages, heavy workloads, 
      and limited access to mental health resources. These challenges not only affect 
      nurses' well-being but also impact the quality of patient care. Organizational 
      support plays a pivotal role in mitigating these issues, yet the lived 
      experiences of nurses regarding such support remain underexplored. AIM: This 
      Study Aimed to Explore Nurses' Lived Experiences of Organizational Support and 
      Its Impact on Their Mental Health Recovery, With a Focus on Identifying 
      Actionable Strategies for Improvement. METHODS: A qualitative phenomenological 
      approach was employed, using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) to 
      gain deep insights into nurses' experiences. Twenty nurses from various 
      healthcare facilities in the Asir region, Saudi Arabia, were recruited through 
      purposive sampling. Data were collected through face-to-face semi-structured 
      interviews and analyzed using thematic analysis to identify recurring patterns 
      and themes. RESULTS: Three main themes emerged: (1) Supportive Leadership, 
      highlighting the critical role of empathetic and communicative leadership in 
      fostering well-being; (2) Systemic Barriers, including staffing shortages, heavy 
      workloads, and limited access to mental health resources; and (3) Workplace 
      Wellness Culture, reflecting the influence of stigma, peer support, and the 
      practicality of wellness programs on mental health recovery. These themes 
      underscore the interconnected nature of leadership, systemic issues, and 
      workplace culture in supporting nurses' mental health. LINKING EVIDENCE TO 
      ACTION: The findings suggest several actionable strategies, including leadership 
      training programs to foster empathy and communication, policies to address 
      systemic barriers, tailored and accessible wellness programs, and initiatives to 
      reduce mental health stigma. These interventions are essential for creating 
      supportive environments that prioritize nurses' well-being and enhance their 
      ability to deliver high-quality care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fluoxetine, an antidepressant, has shown potential anticancer 
      effects. However, its therapeutic efficacy is limited by its poor bioavailability 
      and rapid metabolism. Nanotechnology is advancing medicine, particularly in 
      developing suitable drug delivery systems to improve therapeutic effects and 
      reduce drug side effects. OBJECTIVES: This study aims to synthesize chemically 
      conjugated fluoxetine-dextran nanoparticles (FLX-DEX NPs) to improve the 
      pharmacokinetic profile in plasma and brain to improve antidepressant and 
      anticancer activity against glioma and breast cancer. Besides this, it also 
      targets to reduce the side effects of the drug via delivering the payload to 
      pathological cells. METHODS: Fluoxetine was conjugated to aldehyde-functionalized 
      dextran to give pH stimulus release from its nanoparticles. The spectral and 
      morphological characterization was performed using dynamic light scattering 
      (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), UV, FTIR and (1)HNMR. The stability was 
      determined using thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) and differential scanning 
      calorimetry (DSC) to evaluate thermal stability and phase transitions of the 
      fluoxetine-dextran nanoparticles. Non-compartmental model was employed to compare 
      the pharmacokinetics of FLX and its nanoparticles in the plasma and various parts 
      of Sprague-Dawley rats. Furthermore, the in vitro safety profile, cytotoxic 
      activity on MCF-7 breast cancer and U87 glioma cell lines and antidepressant 
      effects were measured using various animal models. The levels of dopamine and 
      serotonin in brain were monitored after a fortnight treatment of FLX and its NPs. 
      RESULTS: The nanoparticles were found to be round to slightly elliptical, having 
      size less than 50 nm and charge -15-20 mV. These nanoparticles were more stable 
      to the drug as depicted by thermoanalysis. The particles showed a controlled and 
      pH stimuli released. The C(max), T(max), t(1/2), volume of distribution and 
      plasma elimination values were 5.23, 2, 15 h, 1.94 and 0.045, respectively, on 
      oral administration of 30 mg/ kg/day. They passed 20% and 18% viability against 
      MCF-7 and glioma cancer at 10 mg/kg/day dose without retarding its 
      anti-depressant effect. CONCLUSION: FLX-DEX NPs offer dual therapeutic benefits, 
      enhancing anticancer activity and antidepressant effects. The extended half-life 
      and controlled fluoxetine release improved the pharmacokinetics and therapeutic 
      outcomes, suggesting a promising nanotechnology-based approach for cancer and 
      depression treatment.

AB  - Depression affects 8.1% of the German population annually, yet many patients 
      remain resistant to conventional treatments. Given that 85% of individuals with 
      depression also experience chronic insomnia, sleep may represent both a 
      contributing and modifiable treatment factor. This study examines whether adding 
      a fully automated digital cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (dCBT-I) to 
      care-as-usual (CAU) improves depressive symptoms. Participants with comorbid 
      depression and insomnia were randomized to either the intervention group (dCBT-I) 
      or the waiting group (WLC). The intervention was delivered via a mobile app or 
      web platform, consisting of 10 sequential core modules based on evidence-based 
      CBT-I techniques. Assessments took place at baseline, 12- and 24-weeks post 
      randomization. The primary outcome was the severity of depressive symptoms 
      (Patient Health Questionnaire-9; PHQ-9). Secondary outcomes included insomnia 
      severity, daytime sleepiness, fatigue, well-being and mechanistic effect 
      measures. Linear mixed models were calculated to determine between-group effects. 
      A total of 140 participants (120 women, mean age: M = 39.76 +/- 11.65 years) were 
      randomized to dCBT-I (n=70) or WLC (n=70). Large treatment effects at 12- and 24 
      weeks showed significant reductions in depressive symptoms (-3.34 and -2.83; ps 
      <0.001; ds = 0.66-0.78) in the dCBT-I group. Treatment effects in favor of dCBT-I 
      were also found for insomnia severity (ds = 1.46-1.94) and most secondary 
      outcomes (ds = 0.33-1.14). This study demonstrates that digital dCBT-I can be 
      effective not only for individuals with primary insomnia but also for those with 
      depression. These findings align with previous research, highlighting the crucial 
      role of sleep disturbances in depression management. Moreover, the effects 
      remained stable even in the heterogeneous sample investigated in this study, 
      reinforcing the robustness of dCBT-I across diverse patient groups. Thus, dCBT-I 
      emerges as a promising adjunctive treatment. Considering these findings, it is 
      essential to explore the integration of sleep-focused interventions into standard 
      depression treatment. Trial Registration: German Clinical Trial Registry

AB  - Depression, a common psychiatric disorder with multiple causes, has been 
      increasingly linked to viral infections, especially herpesviruses. Epstein-Barr 
      virus (EBV), is a widely infecting Herpesviridae virus. Although some studies 
      have suggested that EBV may be associated with depression, a causal relationship 
      remains unclear. This study aims to explore this link via NHANES data and GWAS 
      findings. We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of 730 NHANES participants aged 
      18--19 years and used weighted regression to assess the link between EBV levels 
      and depression. Subsequently, we conducted univariable Mendelian randomization 
      (UVMR) and multivariable Mendelian randomization (MVMR) analyses with GWAS data 
      from 27,568 depression cases and 457,030 controls and used associated SNPs as 
      instrumental variables to explore the causality and mediators of the 
      EBV-depression association. After controlling for various factors, a significant 
      link between EBV antibody levels and depression persisted, with a nonlinear 
      association (P < 0.001). UVMR analysis revealed a positive causal effect of EBV 
      on depression (OR = 1.008, 95 % CI 1.004-1.012, P < 0.001), implying that it 
      could be a risk factor for depression. The MVMR suggested that IL-6 and CRP may 
      serve as intermediary factors in this process. Cross-sectional studies have 
      revealed a significant link between EBV infection and depression. Furthermore, MR 
      studies have implicated a potential causal role of EBV in the pathogenesis of 
      depression. These findings could inform depression treatment strategies for 
      EBV-infected individuals and provide new insights into the pathogenesis of 
      depression.

AB  - Combination therapy is a proposed strategy in the treatment of depression. 
      Therefore, this research was designed to evaluate the effects of drug 
      combinations of citalopram, bupropion, and lithium on depression-related 
      behaviors induced by dexamethasone (DEX) and aimed to detect the type of 
      interaction among components. Depression-related behaviors were assessed by 
      forced swim test (FST) and tail suspension test (TST), as well as locomotor 
      activity, was assessed using an open-field test (OFT) in male mice. Our results 
      revealed that 24 h after DEX (8 mg/kg; intraperitoneally (i.p.)) administration, 
      the immobility time of the FST and TST increased, proposing a depressive-related 
      behavior. Moreover, 24 h after DEX administration, the number of the CA1 dark 
      cells enhanced, and the level of plasma corticosterone, the primary 
      glucocorticoid in mice, declined. I.p. administrations of lithium (8 mg/kg), 
      bupropion (8 mg/kg) or citalopram (8 mg/kg) diminished the depression-related 
      behaviors induced by DEX via reduction of immobility time in the FST and TST 
      without affecting the locomotor activity, showing an antidepressant-related 
      effect. All two-drug combinations, at subthreshold dosages, exerted 
      antidepressive-related responses. Isobolographic analysis indicated synergistic 
      antidepressant-related effects of citalopram plus bupropion, citalopram plus 
      lithium, as well as bupropion plus lithium. These results suggest synergistic 
      antidepressant-related behaviors of citalopram plus bupropion, citalopram plus 
      lithium, as well as bupropion plus lithium on the amelioration of the 
      depressive-related effects induced by DEX. Combination therapy with citalopram, 
      bupropion, and lithium might be a novel therapeutic approach for depression 
      treatment. However, additional investigations are needed to clarify the exact 
      interactions between components.

TI  - Behavioral Activation With Remote Technology for Emotional Distress Following 
      Moderate-Severe Traumatic Brain Injury: Results of a Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.1097/HTR.0000000000001072 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Examine effects of 8-week Behavioral Activation (BA)-based treatment 
      on emotional distress in moderate-severe traumatic brain injury (msTBI). SETTING: 
      Single TBI rehabilitation center. PARTICIPANTS: Sixty community-dwelling persons 
      with msTBI sustained >/=6 months prior, with at least mild depression and/or 
      anxiety but no suicidal ideation/ psychiatric instability. DESIGN: Randomized 
      controlled trial comparing 2 treatments: the BAT condition delivered in 8 
      sessions of BA (6 face-to-face, 2 phone) with ecological momentary assessment 
      (EMA) and text reminders for increased activity; the INT condition, shown in a 
      previous trial to be highly credible and mildly efficacious, used 1 face-to-face 
      session plus 8 weeks of text reminders framed as implementation intentions for 
      increased activity. MAIN MEASURES: Global Severity Index of Brief Symptom 
      Inventory-18 (BSI-18 GSI; primary outcome); secondary outcome measures of 
      hypothesized BA mechanisms (environmental reward, activation); participation; and 
      quality of life assessed at baseline, post-treatment, 2-month follow-up; Patient 
      Global Impression of Change (PGIC) measured post-treatment. RESULTS: Primary 
      analysis revealed that BAT participants with higher baseline emotional distress 
      had significantly greater improvement in distress (primary outcome) compared to 
      INT participants at post-treatment; this response was attenuated at follow-up. 
      Across distress levels, both measures of BA mechanism showed superior response to 
      BAT at post-treatment and at follow-up. Other secondary outcomes did not differ 
      significantly by treatment, although there was a trend for BAT participants to 
      show more improved health-related quality of life. BAT participants reported 
      significantly greater degree of meaningful change post-treatment (PGIC). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Findings support a growing body of research suggesting that 
      structured, theoretically based approaches to increasing activity linked to 
      personal values can have substantial beneficial impact for many persons with 
      chronic msTBI and emotional distress. Promising future directions include 
      adapting the BAT treatment to remote delivery to improve its potential reach.

TI  - Assessment of Potential Factors Influencing Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity 
      Disorder Drug Adherence: A Database Study.
LID - 10.3390/ijerph22050716 [doi]
LID - 716
AB  - First-line treatment for Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) is 
      pharmacological but is associated with poor success rates in adults. The 
      potential to discontinuously use stimulants may confound adherence assessment. 
      Approximately 30-50% of adults with ADHD will experience depressive episodes, and 
      associated treatment with antidepressants is generally recommended. It can 
      therefore be expected that patients with a formal F90 diagnosis would show higher 
      medication adherence than patients without a diagnosis and that the simultaneous 
      use of antidepressants would increase adherence to ADHD medication. The primary 
      aim was to explore the influence of factors of ADHD diagnosis and comorbid 
      antidepressant use on stimulant adherence. A retrospective, longitudinal 
      pharmacoepidemiological study was conducted on South African community pharmacy 
      dispensing records for 2012-2016 for all patients aged between 18 and 40 years 
      with any record of receiving a drug classified as ""Central nervous system other"" 
      by the MIMS in 2015. Patients endorsed with an ADHD-linked diagnostic code (F90) 
      were identified and contrasted with those receiving ADHD-indicated medication in 
      the absence of a confirmatory diagnostic code. Two methods were applied to assess 
      adherence to ADHD and/or depression treatment drugs: monthly medicine plotting 
      and Proportion of Days Covered (PDC). Patients were classified as being more or 
      less adherent based on monthly medicine plotting criteria. A study population of 
      89 patients was identified: 50 had F90 diagnostic codes and 39 were classified as 
      ""Non F90"". Adherence as measured based on PDC was generally higher for 
      antidepressant use than for methylphenidate for patients classified as being more 
      adherent. A trend towards higher consumption of antidepressants was shown for the 
      treatment-adherent group. Diagnostic code distinction revealed significantly 
      higher adherence rates to methylphenidate for F90 code patients. Adherence rates 
      to antidepressants appeared to be generally higher for non-F90 patients. Many 
      factors may influence adherence to ADHD-indicated drugs; however, the impact of a 
      confirmed diagnosis may be a strong determinant of motivation to be adherent to 
      ADHD pharmacotherapy.

LID - 10.3390/biomedicines13051129 [doi]
LID - 1129
AB  - Background/Objectives: Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a major global health 
      concern that is intimately linked to neuroinflammation, oxidative stress, 
      mitochondrial dysfunction, and complicated metabolic abnormalities. Traditional 
      antidepressants frequently fall short, highlighting the urgent need for new, 
      safer, and more acceptable therapeutic techniques. Phytochemicals, i.e., natural 
      antidepressants derived from plants, are emerging as powerful plant-based 
      therapies capable of targeting many pathogenic pathways at the same time. 
      Summary: This narrative review synthesizes evidence from preclinical and clinical 
      studies on the efficacy of phytochemicals such as curcumin, polyphenols, 
      flavonoids, and alkaloids in lowering depressed symptoms. Consistent data show 
      that these substances have neuroprotective, anti-inflammatory, and antioxidant 
      properties, altering neuroimmune interactions, reducing oxidative damage, and 
      improving mitochondrial resilience. Particularly, polyphenols and flavonoids have 
      great therapeutic potential because of their capacity to penetrate the 
      blood-brain barrier, inhibit cytokine activity, and encourage neuroplasticity 
      mediated by brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF). Despite promising results, 
      the heterogeneity in study designs, phytochemical formulations, and patient 
      demographics highlights the importance of thorough, standardized clinical 
      studies. Conclusions: This review identifies phytochemicals as compelling 
      adjuvant or independent therapies in depression treatment, providing multimodal 
      mechanisms and enhanced tolerability. Additional research into improved dosage, 
      pharmacokinetics, long-term safety, and integrative therapy approaches is 
      essential. Using phytotherapeutics could considerably improve holistic and 
      customized depression care, encouraging new research routes in integrative 
      neuroscience and clinical psychiatry.

TI  - Reward System EEG-fMRI-Pattern Neurofeedback for Major Depressive Disorder with 
      Anhedonia: A Multicenter Pilot Study.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci15050476 [doi]
LID - 476
AB  - Background/Objectives: Up to 75% of patients with major depressive disorder (MDD) 
      exhibit persistent anhedonia symptoms related to abnormalities in the positive 
      valence system. Cumulative evidence points to brain dysfunction in the reward 
      system (RS), including in the ventral striatum, in patients with MDD with 
      anhedonia. This study aims to evaluate the safety and efficacy of a novel 
      neurofeedback (NF) device (termed Prism) which incorporates the EEG-FRI-Pattern 
      biomarker of the reward system (RS-EFP) for use in self-neuromodulation training 
      (RS-EFP-NF) for alleviating depression in patients with MDD with anhedonia. 
      Methods: A total of 49 adults (age range: M = 39.9 +/- 11.03) with a DSM-5 
      diagnosis of MDD with anhedonia (per a SHAPS-C score >/= 25) were screened for the 
      administration of ten sessions of RS-EFP-NF twice a week on nonconsecutive days. 
      Depression and anhedonia severity was assessed, respectively, by HDRS-17 and 
      SHAPS-C at baseline, midway, and treatment end. Results: A total of 34 patients 
      (77%) completed the protocol and were included in the analyses. No device-related 
      adverse events were serious or required treatment. Depression symptoms were 
      reduced at end of treatment as indicated by the HDRS-17, with a reduction of 
      eight points on average (95% CI: -10.5 to -5.41, p < 0.0001), a clinical 
      improvement rate of 78.47%, and a remission rate of 32.25%. Anhedonia, as 
      indicated by the SHAPS-C score, was diminished, showing an average reduction of 
      6.3 points (95% CI: -8.51 to -4.14, p < 0.0001). Conclusions: 
      Self-neuromodulation using RS-EFP-NF is a promising and safe treatment for MDD 
      with anhedonia. The intervention demonstrates substantial clinical effects on 
      both depression and anhedonia symptoms, with high patient acceptability and 
      retention. Prism may address a critical mechanism-driven treatment gap for 
      anhedonia that often persists despite conventional therapies. Larger controlled 
      implementation, efficacy, and dosing studies are warranted.

AB  - IMPORTANCE: Available antidepressants provide inadequate therapeutic responses in 
      many patients with major depressive disorder (MDD), highlighting a substantial 
      unmet need. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of azetukalner, a 
      novel, potent KV7 potassium channel opener, in participants with MDD. DESIGN, 
      SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: X-NOVA was a multicenter, proof-of-concept, phase 2, 
      randomized, double-blind, parallel-group, placebo-controlled clinical trial that 
      evaluated azetukalner in participants (adults aged >/=18 to </=65 years) with 
      moderate to severe MDD in a current depressive episode. Participants were 
      enrolled between April 2022 and October 2023, and data analysis occurred from 
      January 2023 to January 2024. INTERVENTION: Participants were randomized (1:1:1) 
      to 10 mg of azetukalner, 20 mg of azetukalner, or placebo orally once daily with 
      food for 6 weeks, with a 4-week follow-up. Concomitant antidepressant medications 
      were not permitted. MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary efficacy end point 
      was change in Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale (MADRS) score at week 6. 
      Secondary end points included change from baseline at week 6 in the 
      Snaith-Hamilton Pleasure Scale (SHAPS) and Beck Anxiety Inventory. Exploratory 
      end points included change in the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale, 17-Item 
      (HAM-D17) score and change in MADRS at week 1. Frequency and severity of 
      treatment-emergent adverse events (TEAEs) were recorded. RESULTS: Altogether, 168 
      participants were randomized (56 to placebo, 56 to 10 mg of azetukalner, and 56 
      to 20 mg of azetukalner); mean (SD) age was 47.2 (13.6) years, and 111 
      participants (66.5%) were female. The modified intent-to-treat and safety 
      populations consisted of 164 and 167 participants, respectively. The mean (SE) 
      reduction in MADRS scores from baseline to week 6 was -13.90 (1.41) points with 
      placebo, -15.61 (1.34) points with 10 mg of azetukalner, and -16.94 (1.45) points 
      with 20 mg of azetukalner; the mean (SE) reduction with 20 mg of azetukalner vs 
      placebo was clinically meaningful but not statistically significant (-3.04 
      points; 95% CI, -7.04 to 0.96 points; P = .14) at week 6, while significant at 
      week 1 (-2.66 points; 95% CI, -5.30 to -0.03 points; P = .047). The mean (SE) 
      reduction in HAM-D17 from baseline to week 6 was significantly greater with 20 mg 
      of azetukalner vs placebo (-13.3 [1.1] vs -10.2 [1.0] points; P = .04). The mean 
      (SE) reduction in SHAPS scores from baseline to week 6 was significantly greater 
      with 20 mg of azetukalner vs placebo (-7.77 [0.87] vs -5.30 [0.85] points; 
      P = .046). Similar rates of discontinuation due to TEAEs were reported across 
      groups. CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this randomized clinical trial of 
      azetukalner, preliminary findings supported its further clinical development for 
      the treatment of MDD and anhedonia. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials.gov 
      Identifier: NCT05376150.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Approximately half of all individuals who die by suicide in Norway do 
      not seek contact with specialist mental health services during the year before 
      death. Here we aim to report the demographic characteristics and attitudes to 
      suicide, mental ill health, and help-seeking in people who do not wish to seek 
      help or information for suicide thoughts. Moreover, we identify the strongest 
      predictors of non-help-seeking intentions. METHODS: A population sample 
      (N = 3251) from the Mid- and West- Norway regions participated in an online 
      survey of attitudes to suicide and help-seeking for mental ill health. The sample 
      was recruited from the regional population that later was exposed to a media 
      suicide prevention campaign. Of these, 167 individuals stated that they would not 
      seek help or information if they were to get suicide thoughts. RESULTS: The group 
      of people who would not seek help or information for suicide thoughts, were more 
      likely to be male, aged between 40 and 49 years, not being retired, or having 
      experienced suicide or suicide attempts among family or friends, compared to the 
      group that stated their help-seeking intentions. Moreover, they were more likely 
      to report more negative attitudes to suicide (e.g., believing it can't be 
      prevented, or that it should not be talked about), mental illness (e.g., wanting 
      to hide depression, or wanting to sort out problems on their own), and 
      help-seeking (e.g., feeling inferior if seeking professional help, or not being 
      confident in getting help) as well as lower levels of support from family or 
      friends. Stepwise logistic regression analyses identified male sex, not being 
      confident in getting professional help for suicide thoughts, not being able to 
      talk to family or friends about problems, and not wanting to disclose having 
      depression, as the statistically significant predictors of not wanting to seek 
      help or information, explaining 28% of the variance. CONCLUSIONS: We conclude 
      that these factors should be targeted in future suicide prevention efforts in 
      Norway. In particular, the strongest predictor (Not being confident in getting 
      professional care for suicide thoughts), should be addressed. CLINICAL TRIAL

AB  - BACKGROUND: Gut microbiota (GM) alterations have been implicated in depression, 
      potentially mediated via changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC). However, the 
      causal relationship and underlying biological mechanisms remain unclear. METHODS: 
      Summary statistics from genome-wide association studies (GWAS) of 473 GM 
      (n = 5959), depression (43,280 cases, 329,192 controls), and 3935 brain 
      imaging-derived phenotypes (IDPs) (n = 33,224) were utilized. Univariable 
      Mendelian randomization (MR) analyses examined the associations between (i) GM 
      and depression, (ii) depression and GM, (iii) brain IDPs and depression, and (iv) 
      GM and PFC-related IDPs. Multivariable MR (MVMR) assessed whether PFC structural 
      phenotypes mediated the effect of GM on depression risk. Summary-data-based MR 
      (SMR) identified potential genes and therapeutic targets. Single-cell RNA 
      sequencing and bulk RNA data from GEO database about PFC tissue of depression 
      patients were analyzed for biomarker expression and regulatory mechanisms. Target 
      genes were validated in mice model through behavioral tests, RT-qPCR, and 
      immunofluorescence analyses. Drug prediction and molecular docking explored 
      potential therapeutic targets and traditional Chinese medicine. RESULTS: The 
      analysis identified 15 positive and 16 negative causal effects between GM and 
      depression. Reverse MR analysis revealed 36 GM traits with reverse causality to 
      depression. After excluding results with heterogeneity and pleiotropy, 11 
      PFC-related IDPs exhibited causal relationships with depression. MVMR adjustment 
      for genetically predicted GM levels showed that the effects of PFC-related IDPs 
      remained significant, indicating mediation of GM's effect on depression. 
      Integration of GWAS and eQTL data identified 14 genes passing the SMR test. 
      Differential expression of these genes was observed across cell types and between 
      patients with depression and healthy controls. FARS2 and SLC25A21 were identified 
      as potential therapeutic targets for depression, with protective effects shown in 
      MR analysis (FARS2: OR: 0.892, 95 % CI: 0.813-0.971, P = 0.005; SLC25A21: OR: 
      0.924, 95 % CI: 0.851-0.997, P = 0.035). Reduced expression of FARS2 and SLC25A21 
      was validated in CUMS induced mice, along with depressive-like behaviors 
      confirmed through behavioral tests. Molecular docking predicted Betanidin, 
      Aloenin B, Rehmannioside D, and Vicenin-2 as potential drugs targeting both FARS2 
      and SLC25A21. CONCLUSION: This study supports causal relationships between 
      specific GM and depression, with PFC structures potentially mediating these 
      effects. The findings provide insights into personalized depression treatment 
      strategies and identify promising candidate targets and drugs for future 
      research.

AB  - Depression is a chronic and recurrent neuropsychiatric disorder with complex 
      pathophysiology. Dihydromyricetin (DMY), a bioactive flavonoid compound isolated 
      from Ampelopsis grossedentata (commonly known as rattan tea), has demonstrated 
      multiple pharmacological properties including anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, 
      antitumor, and antimicrobial activities. In the present study, a well-established 
      rodent model of depression was generated through chronic unpredictable mild 
      stress (CUMS) paradigm combined with social isolation. Following eight weeks of 
      DMY intervention, comprehensive behavioral assessments were conducted to validate 
      both the successful establishment of the depression model and the therapeutic 
      efficacy of DMY treatment. We employed network pharmacology approaches to 
      systematically predict potential antidepressant targets of DMY. Further 
      mechanistic investigations were performed to elucidate the underlying molecular 
      pathways, providing novel perspectives for developing innovative antidepressant 
      therapeutics.Integrating network pharmacology prediction with molecular biology 
      validation, our findings revealed that DMY exerts significant antidepressant-like 
      effects through suppression of the advanced glycosylation end products 
      (AGEs)-RAGE signaling pathway, activation of the nuclear factor E2-related factor 
      2 (NRF2)-mediated antioxidant defense system, and upregulation of synaptic 
      plasticity-related proteins including postsynaptic density protein 95 (PSD95) and 
      synaptophysin (SYP). These results suggest that DMY may represent a promising 
      natural therapeutic candidate for depression treatment.

LID - e82924
AB  - Depression, anxiety, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), and Alzheimer's disease 
      (AD) pose ongoing therapeutic challenges, particularly in aging populations. 
      Conventional pharmacologic treatments often have delayed onset, limited efficacy, 
      and unfavorable side effects, prompting interest in natural alternatives. Saffron 
      (Crocus sativus L.), a spice long used in traditional medicine, has emerged as a 
      promising candidate due to its multimodal neuroprotective properties. This review 
      evaluated the clinical efficacy, safety, and mechanistic profile of saffron in 
      the treatment of mood and cognitive disorders. A targeted literature search 
      identified multiple double-blind randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 
      meta-analyses comparing saffron to standard pharmacologic agents or placebo. In 
      depression, RCTs using 30 mg/day of saffron for six weeks showed comparable 
      improvements in Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM-D) scores to fluoxetine (20 
      mg/day), with significant reductions from baseline and no difference in adverse 
      events. An adjunctive study using crocin (an active ingredient of saffron; 15 mg 
      twice daily) also demonstrated additive effects alongside selective serotonin 
      reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs). In cognitive disorders, saffron (30 mg/day) showed 
      non-inferiority to donepezil (10 mg/day) and memantine (20 mg/day) in patients 
      with mild-to-moderate and moderate-to-severe AD. Trials lasting 16 to 52 weeks 
      demonstrated significant improvements on validated cognitive scales such as 
      Alzheimer's Disease Assessment Scale - Cognitive Subscale (ADAS-Cog) and Clinical 
      Dementia Rating - Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), with fewer gastrointestinal side effects 
      compared to standard treatments. Meta-analyses confirm the superiority of saffron

AB  - BACKGROUND: Urban, ethnically/racially diverse, impoverished people are 
      predisposed to experience unaddressed depression and anxiety. The use of lay 
      mental health ambassadors (MHAs) may effectively expand access to mental health 
      care in underserved neighborhoods. AIMS: This study described the role of lay 
      MHAs as they provided mental health prevention in their communities. METHODS: 
      Using community-based participatory research in the context of long-term 
      partnerships between a department of nursing and three urban, racially/ethnically 
      diverse, and impoverished neighborhoods, the researchers trained 22 Black, White, 
      and Hispanic neighborhood residents to serve as lay MHAs. Descriptive data were 
      collected on the MHAs, their ""touches"" (mental health conversations) with 
      community residents, responses to these ""touches,"" and role satisfaction of the 
      MHAs. RESULTS: The MHAs conducted 3,782 ""touches"" with 1,614 persons during the 
      28 months of data collection. The recipients of the ""touches"" were primarily 
      female, middle-aged, and Black. The MHAs employed the strategies of listening and 
      teaching self-care/coping strategies most often. Neighborhood residents' major 
      ""take aways"" from the ""touches"" were education and resources. The MHAs were 
      highly satisfied with their role. MHA mental health literacy increased, and 
      mental health stigma decreased from before to 4 to 9 months after training. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The community-driven solution of training lay MHAs to do preventive, 
      upstream mental health work in their neighborhoods holds potential to address 
      existing mental health inequities. This study contributes to an emerging evidence 
      base that can empower communities and nurses to collaborate in the development of 
      useful research agendas, meaningful policy, and tailored mental health care.

AB  - Childhood trauma resulting from violence, abuse, and neglect has long-term 
      effects on health and is linked to the development of diseases and mental 
      disorders, including depression. It turns out that traumatic experiences in 
      childhood can also foster traits of perfectionism, whose maladaptive form may 
      further increase the risk of developing depression. The aim of this study was to 
      assess the role of perfectionism in the relationship between childhood trauma and 
      depression in adulthood. The analysis involved 308 participants (73 with 
      depression and 235 healthy controls). The study used questionnaires assessing 
      childhood traumatic experiences (MACE-58) and perfectionism levels (KPAD). The 
      results showed that individuals with depression exhibited higher maladaptive 
      perfectionism and a greater severity of trauma, particularly physical violence 
      and sexual abuse. Traumatic experiences, especially sexual abuse and physical 
      violence from peers, were significant predictors of depression. It was found that 
      maladaptive perfectionism mediated the relationship between trauma and 
      depression, eliminating the direct link in the case of some traumas, such as 
      sexual abuse. The study highlights the significant role of maladaptive 
      perfectionism in the development of depression in individuals who experienced 
      traumatic events in childhood, suggesting that interventions aimed at reducing 
      this type of perfectionism may positively impact depression treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Patients with cancer and pre-existing severe mental disorders (SMD) 
      have higher cancer mortality rates, but research on barriers to optimal treatment 
      is limited, particularly from the perspectives of patients and relatives. This 
      qualitative study aimed to highlight the experiences of patients and relatives 
      regarding their cancer trajectories in Denmark to explore barriers to optimal 
      cancer care for this patient population. METHODS: A total of 11 semi-structured 
      individual interviews were conducted with eight patients with cancer and 
      pre-existing SMD and three relatives. An eclectic theoretical framework was 
      applied to explore the participants' and relatives' experiences. RESULTS: 
      Identified barriers included mental health stigma and lack of direct 
      communication about the patients' SMD with oncology staff. While most 
      participants wished to undergo the recommended cancer treatment, some feared 
      adverse psychiatric side effects and worsening of mental health symptoms. 
      Additionally, participants reported barriers such as limited consultation time, 
      lack of clinician continuity and social isolation, which impeded access to 
      sufficient information and support during their cancer trajectory. CONCLUSIONS: 
      The study identified barriers such as mental health stigma and insufficient 
      communication about patients' mental disorders. A patient-centred approach to 
      cancer care, which includes formal guidelines and training for healthcare 
      professionals, is recommended. FUNDING: The work was supported by the Danish 
      Cancer Society [grant number R283-A16499]. TRIAL REGISTRATION: Not relevant.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Zhi-Zi-Chi decoction (ZZCD), a famous classical 
      prescription of traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), has long been used for 
      depression treatment, but its detailed molecular anti-depression mechanisms 
      remain to be further elucidated. AIM OF THE STUDY: To explore the antidepressant 
      properties and potential mechanisms of ZZCD in ameliorating depression-like 
      behavior through network pharmacology and in vivo experimental validation. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: A chronic unpredictable mild stress (CUMS)-induced mouse 
      depressive model was established in this present study. The sucrose preference 
      test (SPT) and tail suspension test (TST) were performed to assess the 
      antidepressant effects of ZZCD. In addition, the underlying molecular mechanisms 
      of ZZCD against depression were dissected using an integrated network 
      pharmacology approach, and these predicted results were verified in a mouse 
      depressive model. Subsequently, the levels of inflammatory cytokines, 
      neurotransmitters, genes or proteins associated with potential targets as well as 
      the related proteins of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathways were measured using 
      ELISA kits, RT-qPCR, and Western blot. RESULTS: ZZCD effectively ameliorated 
      CUMS-induced depressive behavior of mice. Treatments with ZZCD at doses of 3 and 
      6 g/kg obviously improved the sucrose preference rate in the SPT and attenuated 
      the accumulated immobility time in the TST of CUMS mice. This was accompanied by 
      a decrease in inflammatory factor levels and restoration of the 
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) levels in the hippocampi. The network informatics 
      results revealed that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway, AKT1, TNF-alpha, and IL-6 
      might be the potential targets of ZZCD against depression. Correspondingly, an in 
      vivo experiment verified that treatment with ZZCD up-regulated the protein 
      expression levels of p-PI3K/PI3K, p-AKT/AKT, and p-mTOR/mTOR related to the 
      PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway and reversed the mRNA expression levels of IL-6, TNF-alpha, and 
      AKT1 in the hippocampi. CONCLUSION: Our research suggested that ZZCD had 
      antidepressant effects in CUMS-induced depressive mice. The mechanisms underlying 
      the effects of ZZCD against depression were associated with the modulation of 
      inflammatory factor levels as well as related genes or protein expression of the 
      PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway. Accordingly, ZZCD might serve as a clinically promising 
      TCM prescription for depression treatment.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Sexual minority women (SMW; women who self-identify as lesbian, 
      queer, etc., as well as heterosexually-identified women who experience attraction 
      to romantic or sexual partnerships with women) and vulnerabilized women (those 
      marginalized due to structural forces such as housing insecurity, violence, sex 
      exchange, drug use, or HIV positive status) experience a range of mental health 
      challenges compared to their heterosexual and general population counterparts. 
      General populations studies show a positive relationship between social support 
      and mental health; less is known about SMW experiencing intersecting 
      multi-layered vulnerabilities. This study characterizes mental health stressors, 
      identifies social support sources and forms, and explores the relationship 
      between social support and mental health among vulnerabilized SMW in Baltimore, 
      MD. METHODS: We conducted virtual, in-depth semi-structured interviews with 
      vulnerabilized cisgender SMW (n = 25) between June and October 2021. We utilized 
      an inductive analytical approach to identify central themes and develop a 
      categorization structure. Results are presented using narrative synthesis and 
      illustrative quotes. To understand different forms of mental health-related 
      social support provided across sources, data was sorted into a matrix and 
      analyzed. RESULTS: Vulnerabilized SMW commonly self-reported depression and 
      anxiety. Participants identified three primary mental health stressors: 1) 
      managing identity-related stigma; 2) relationships, loss, and isolation; and 3) 
      financial struggles. The most important type of social support for mental health 
      was non-judgement related to sexual orientation and/or mental health struggles. 
      Family, friends, and partners were providing similar amounts of support, 
      primarily emotional support. DISCUSSION: Vulnerabilized SMW have unique mental 
      health and social support-related experiences and needs, potentially attributed 
      to experiences with multiple marginalization, compounded by struggles with 
      intersecting structural vulnerabilities. More research is warranted to explore 
      different sources and forms of social support as predictors of mental health. 
      Findings indicate need for public health interventions that address sexual 
      orientation and mental health stigma.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Several instruments have been developed to measure stigma associated 
      with mental disorders. The Reported and Intended Behaviour Scale (RIBS) is one of 
      the validated questionnaires to assess the presence of stigma and discrimination 
      against people with mental illness in the general population. It consists of 
      eight items, divided into two subscales that measure reported and intended 
      stigmatizing behaviours. This study aimed to translate and validate the RIBS in 
      Persian. METHODS: We translated the RIBS questionnaire from English into Persian 
      (RIBS-P) and back-translated it into English. Thereafter, ten psychiatrists 
      evaluated its face validity. Between 2020 and 2021, 384 Persian-speaking adults 
      (aged 18-60) residing in various cities across Iran, with internet access, 
      participated in the study. Exploratory factor analyses were performed to 
      determine the construct validity. The reliability of the questionnaire was 
      assessed using internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient) and 
      test-retest methods. RESULTS: Most of the participants were 28-37 (53.9%), female 
      (64.6%), married (51.6%), unemployed (67.7%) and educated (100%). The total 
      Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the RIBS-P questionnaire was high (0.732) and 
      The test-retest results showed no significant difference. Factor analysis was 
      used for construct validity and resulted in the extraction of one factor, the 
      mean, standard deviation, and Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the extracted 
      factor were 3.25, 1.02 and 0.807. The items with the highest correlation with the 
      extracted factor from the exploratory analysis were identified (>0.6). Age 
      (0.00000010701), working status (0.00000010833), and education (0.00000010329) 
      had a significant relationship with stigmatisation behaviour. CONCLUSION: The 
      findings indicate that the Persian version of the RIBS is valid and reliable for 
      assessing stigmatizing behaviours among Iranians.

AB  - Approximately 13% of children and adolescents struggle with a mental health 
      disorder. Adolescents must often disclose information about their mental health 
      (MH) distress to their parents to receive social support or professional care, 
      but parents' anticipated responses to these disclosures have also been identified 
      as a barrier to disclosure. This study explored factors that influence parents' 
      negative emotional response to MH disclosure. Parents (N = 322) of adolescents 
      were recruited to take an online survey that explored their depression literacy, 
      stigmatizing beliefs about depression, and perceptions of a positive parent/child 
      relationship. Results suggest that parents' depression literacy is indirectly 
      related to parents' negative emotional response to disclosure through influencing 
      parents' depression stigma, and this indirect relationship was higher among 
      parents who perceived a more warm parent/child relationship. The proposed model 
      shows that parents' depression literacy was first negatively associated with 
      parents' stigmatizing beliefs and that this was indirectly related to parents' 
      negative emotional response to disclosure. Physicians, MH professionals, and 
      parents can use these findings to better understand factors that influence 
      parents' negative responses to MH disclosures.

LID - 10.3233/SHTI250569 [doi]
AB  - Patients with chronic illnesses need innovative counseling strategies for better 
      self-care throughout their condition. The effectiveness of digital health 
      treatments for managing depression and treatment adherence remains unclear due to 
      fragmented evidence. This scoping review investigates existing research on 
      digital health treatments for depressive disorders, particularly focusing on 
      patient satisfaction. A systematic search was conducted in PubMed, Scopus, and 
      CINAHL for 386 studies published up to 2024, resulting in nine studies being 
      analyzed. The findings suggest that digital health interventions generally 
      improve patient satisfaction, though this was not a primary focus in most 
      studies. Further research is needed to better integrate digital health solutions 
      into depression treatment.

PG  - 867-877
LID - 10.1080/03007995.2025.2505692 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Vortioxetine is a multimodal antidepressant approved for the treatment 
      of major depressive episodes. As part of the overall European risk-management 
      plan, we aimed to fill data gaps on relevant missing information such as the 
      extent of vortioxetine use in special populations and assessment of selected 
      potential risks. METHODS: This non-interventional post-authorization safety study 
      used longitudinal administrative claims/medical records data from 10,358 patients 
      newly prescribed vortioxetine in Finland, Spain, and the Netherlands (EU-PAS 
      register: EUPAS19199). RESULTS: Elderly patients (>/=75 years) accounted for 3-14% 
      of the assessed populations, while off-label pediatric prescribing was low 
      (0.1-0.5%). Patients with a comorbid diagnosis of mania/hypomania accounted for 
      0.4-10% of the population, while patients with comorbid neurological conditions 
      accounted for </=3% of patients. The median prescribed daily vortioxetine dose was 
      10 mg and mean exposure was 72-238 days. The proportions of patients who had one 
      of the events of interest (suicidal events, epilepsy, convulsions/seizures, 
      severe renal or hepatic events) recorded during vortioxetine exposure were all 
      </=1%. CONCLUSION: In this European healthcare database study, the extent and 
      characteristics of vortioxetine use were in line with clinical trial experience 
      and the current label. Analyses of events, including those of special interest, 
      did not raise any new safety concerns.

OAB - For people with major depressive disorder (MDD), it is crucial that 
      antidepressant treatments, like vortioxetine, are safe and well-tolerated to 
      ensure patients stick with their medication and achieve successful treatment 
      outcomes. The European Medicines Authority often requires drug manufacturers to 
      evaluate potential risks once a drug is in regular use. This evaluation, known as 
      a ""risk management plan"", looks at how the drug is used in everyday practice and 
      assesses its safety, especially in vulnerable patients. As part of the European 
      Vortioxetine Risk Management Plan, researchers used health data from Finland, 
      Spain, and the Netherlands to: 1.Understand how vortioxetine is being used in 
      patients who were not included in earlier clinical trials. This includes elderly 
      people, children, stroke survivors, pregnant women, and those living with other 
      long-term conditions like mania/hypomania, Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's 
      disease, multiple sclerosis, and severe kidney or liver problems.2.Look for rare 
      safety risks such as suicide, seizures, kidney or liver side-effects, and the 
      potential for drug abuse.The study analyzed data from over 10,000 patients 
      treated with vortioxetine. It found that vortioxetine was generally used as 
      recommended in the European prescribing guidelines, with an average daily dose of 
      10 mg in all three countries. Depression treatment guidelines recommend long-term 
      use of antidepressants for at least 6-12 months to prevent relapse, and the study 
      confirmed that vortioxetine is typically used for about 7-8 months on average. 
      The analysis did not reveal any new safety concerns, supporting the established 
      safety profile of vortioxetine.

AB  - This review examines the potential of next-generation probiotics (NGPs) in cancer 
      treatment. It examines their modes of action, therapeutic safety, effectiveness, 
      and the barriers to their integration into medical practice. With cancer 
      incidence increasing worldwide, especially in resource-limited countries, NGPs 
      including Faecalibacterium prausnitzii and Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum enhance 
      gut barrier integrity and suppress tumors by producing SCFAs like butyrate, 
      supporting epithelial cells and immune responses while reducing CRC progression 
      without toxicity. Akkermansia muciniphila and Lactococcus lactis MG1363 boost 
      chemotherapy efficacy and immunity via JAK-STAT and Th17 pathways, increasing 
      IFN-gamma, IL-6, and TNF-alpha. Lacocaseibacillus casei and Bacillus amyloliquefaciens 
      promote M1 macrophage polarization and reduce chronic inflammation by modulating 
      NF-kappaB/STAT3. Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, Bacteroides 
      fragilis, and Lacticaseibacillus rhamnosus induce apoptosis and cell cycle arrest 
      via MAPK downregulation, mTOR suppression, and caspase activation. 
      Bifidobacterium longum, Lactobacillus acidophilus, and Streptococcus salivarius 
      aid cancer prevention by binding heterocyclic amines and reducing carcinogenic 
      enzymes. Lacocaseibacillus casei, Lactiplantibacillus plantarum, and 
      Bifidobacterium bifidum mitigate CRC by lowering oxidative stress and lipid 
      peroxidation. In contrast, Limosilactobacillus fermentum and Lactiplantibacillus 
      plantarum enhance vincristine chemotherapy by reducing beta-glucosidase activity and 
      chemotherapy toxicity. Against Helicobacter pylori, Lactiplantibacillus 
      plantarum, Lacocaseibacillus casei L26, Bifidobacterium animalis subsp. lactis 
      B94, and Bifidobacterium bifidum CP5 decrease IL-1beta, increase IL-10, and inhibit 
      bacterial adhesion, reducing ulcers and inflammation. However, challenges in NGP 
      production include strain selection, survivability, scalability, and regulation. 
      Successful commercialization requires advancements in culturing techniques, 
      genome editing, and harmonized safety guidelines. Therefore, further research is 
      needed to optimize clinical applications and ensure safety.

AB  - In recent years, the incidence of metabolic disorders has exponentially increased 
      worldwide mainly due to the misfunctioning of chemical reactions. Gestational 
      diabetes mellitus (GDM) occurred during pregnancy when placenta prevent 
      absorption of sufficient insulin in mother's body. Although this disorder usually 
      disappears after delivery, it could raise the probability of developing 
      complications in the future. GDM is associated with adverse effects on women and 
      their children, such as obesity, cardiovascular disease, and type 2 diabetes. On 
      the other hand, administration of probiotics as a live microorganism with the 
      wide array of health values could contribute to restore and stabilize gut 
      microbiota and subsequently regulate essential internal functions such as 
      development of immunity. In this review, we focus primarily on some causes and 
      effects of GDM in pregnant women and then Faecalibacterium prasnitzii, the most 
      abundant butyrate-producing bacterium in gut, which have been using as a 
      prominent biomarker in health and disease and also potential anti-inflammatory 
      treatment owing to the production of active molecules.

OAB - Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is a condition in which a woman's body has 
      difficulty processing sugar properly during pregnancy, leading to high blood 
      sugar levels. This can cause health problems for both the mother and baby, such 
      as increased risks of obesity, heart disease, and type 2 diabetes later in life. 
      Researchers are exploring how gut bacteria, especially one called 
      Faecalibacterium prausnitzii ;(F. prausnitzii), might help prevent or manage GDM. 
      F. prausnitzii is a type of beneficial bacteria found in the intestines that 
      helps maintain a healthy digestive system. It produces a substance called 
      butyrate, which helps control inflammation and improves how the body handles 
      sugar. Studies show that women with GDM often have lower levels of this 
      beneficial bacteria, which could contribute to their difficulty managing blood 
      sugar. By increasing the amount of F. prausnitzii in the gut, either through 
      diet, probiotics, or other treatments, it might be possible to reduce 
      inflammation, improve insulin sensitivity, and help women with GDM manage their 
      blood sugar better. However, more research and clinical trials are needed to 
      confirm how safe and effective this approach would be. This study highlights the 
      potential role of F. prausnitzii in treating GDM and suggests that future 
      therapies might focus on using this bacteria to improve health during and after 
      pregnancy.

AB  - Coeliac disease is characterised by immune-mediated damage to the small intestine 
      in response to dietary gluten in genetically predisposed individuals. Increased 
      intestinal permeability is a central component to its pathophysiology. This 
      review explores the evidence for increased permeability in coeliac disease and 
      the underlying mechanisms, including the roles of zonulin, inflammatory 
      cytokines, microbial alterations and immune responses to gliadin peptides. We 
      also review comprehensively the therapies targeting barrier integrity and 
      normalising intestinal permeability, including particular diets and supplements, 
      and experimental and improved medications including larazotide acetate and 
      IMU-856. Finally, we highlight the need for reliable biomarkers for evaluating 
      increased permeability in coeliac disease and advocate for further research on 
      therapies which normalise barrier function, particularly as a strategy to 
      maintain remission.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Maternal and child malnutrition is a significant public health 
      concern in Pakistan, with 40% of children under five being stunted. In response, 
      the Government of Pakistan initiated the Benazir Nashonuma Programme (BNP), a 
      nutritional supplementation programme for pregnant women, mothers of children 
      aged 0 to 23 months and children aged 6 to 24 months. This study aims to evaluate 
      the effectiveness of the BNP in reducing childhood stunting and improving 
      maternal and child health outcomes. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: A quasi-experimental 
      longitudinal study comprising baseline, midline and endline surveys will be 
      conducted across 18 districts (9 intervention and 9 control) in Pakistan. The 
      surveys will use a two-stage cluster sampling method to enrol 13 200 children 
      aged 0-59 months and their mothers from the Benazir Income Support Programme 
      households. The primary outcome of interest is the prevalence of under-five 
      stunting. We will use a difference-in-differences approach to estimate the impact 
      by comparing the documented changes over time between the intervention and 
      control groups. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study will provide critical 
      insights into the effectiveness of the BNP in addressing childhood undernutrition 
      in Pakistan. The findings will inform policy and programmatic decisions aimed at 
      reducing undernutrition in resource-constrained settings. Ethical approval has 
      been obtained from the Ethics Review Committee of Aga Khan University and the 
      Pakistan National Bioethics Committee. TRIAL REGISTRATION NUMBER: NCT06025786.

AB  - Hard carbon-based sodium-ion batteries (SIBs) anodes still face a significant

      result in an irreversible natrization during the initial charging process. The 
      pre-sodiation strategy is designed to compensate for the consumption of sodium 
      ions, typically achieved by adding sodium ion supplements. In this study, we 
      propose an intrinsic pre-sodiation strategy based on hardwood kraft lignin (HKL), 
      which is extracted using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) and sodium sulfide. 
      Self-supported HKL ultrafine carbon fiber anodes with varying sodium contents 
      (HKL-NaX-CFs) were prepared successfully through electrospinning, stabilization, 
      and carbonization. The effects of NaOH on HKL under the dual influences of 
      pre-sodiation and activation was investigated systematically, including the 
      interaction between NaOH and HKL, the thermal properties of HKL, the morphology, 
      microcrystalline structure and electrochemical properties of HKL-based ultrafine 
      carbon fibers (HKL-CFs). Results indicate that pre-sodiation strategy increased 
      the layer spacing of graphite lamella, pore volume, and diffusion-controlled 
      capacity of HKL-CFs, leading to better capacity and rate performance. Notably, 
      the HKL-Na2-CF anode exhibited a capacity of 231.7 mAh g(-1) at 30 mA g(-1) and 
      68.3 mAh g(-1) at 2000 mA g(-1). The intrinsic pre-sodiation strategy offers an 
      inspiration for the supplement of sodium ions.

AB  - Management of the brown marmorated stink bug, Halyomorpha halys (Stal), using 
      attract-and-kill (AK) strategies in orchard crops has resulted in reduced 
      pesticide inputs and the reestablishment of integrated pest management programs 
      but also increased labor inputs and damage in pheromone-baited AK trees. Here, we 
      re-tool previously developed AK practices for H. halys management using 
      long-lasting insecticide netting (LLIN) as a low-input, effective killing agent. 
      Simple LLIN AK stations were evaluated for efficacy compared with grower standard 
      practices when hung directly on orchard perimeter fruit trees, hung on posts 
      near, but not touching perimeter trees, and placed outside the orchard perimeter 
      in commercial Mid-Atlantic apple orchards from 2017 to 2019. Treatments in which 
      LLIN stations were attached to or hung near perimeter trees were equivalent to 
      grower standards in terms of H. halys injury. In commercial pear orchards in 
      Washington State in 2018 to 2020, efficacies of several LLIN station designs were 
      evaluated as supplements to grower standard practices. A novel LLIN station 
      design, referred to as the poncho trap, consistently caught nearly 3-fold more H. 
      halys compared to a simple post-deployed ""ghost trap"" design when installed 
      outside orchard perimeters. However, only LLIN stations mounted directly to 
      perimeter trees provided statistically significant reductions in fruit damage. 
      Our overall findings underscore the importance of positioning the pheromone lure, 
      host plant (fruit tree), and LLIN in close proximity for successful AK H. halys 
      management. Results also indicate that poncho trap LLIN fabric flaps could be 
      integrated into near-mounted LLIN stations to further increase efficacy.

AB  - Dysbiosis is increasingly linked to allergy development. This study evaluates the 
      efficacy of the multi-strain probiotic SYN-53 in the management of allergic 
      rhinoconjunctivitis (ARC). Eighty-four subjects with confirmed grass pollen 
      allergy underwent up to three bi-weekly 3-day intake cycles with SYN-53 or 
      placebo. After each cycle, subjects were exposed to grass pollen in an allergen 
      exposure chamber. ARC symptoms were assessed using the Total Symptom Score (TSS) 
      before and after each use of SYN-53. After one intake cycle, SYN-53 already 
      showed a trend towards greater efficacy over placebo, which became significant 
      after two cycles (DeltaTSS(MAX): -3.44 +/- 0.42 vs. -1.87 +/- 0.37; p = 0.0067), with 38% 
      vs. 24% symptom relief. In subjects with moderate to severe symptoms, SYN-53 was 
      already significantly superior after one single intake cycle and improved further 
      after two cycles (DeltaTSS(MAX): -4.78 +/- 0.51 vs. -2.43 +/- 0.47; p = 0.0014), with 45% 
      vs. 26% symptom relief. SYN-53 is effective in the management of ARC, 
      highlighting the role of bacterial diversity and dosage in probiotic nutritional 
      supplements.

LID - 10.1007/s12602-025-10625-z [doi]
AB  - Probiotic supplementation can mitigate hepatic injury, but the low survival rate 
      of probiotics through the gastrointestinal tract limits their therapeutic 
      efficacy. This study aimed to enhance the viability of Pediococcus acidilactici 
      (P. acidilactici) by encapsulating it in an alginate-pectin matrix coated with 
      chitosan (APC) and to evaluate the hepatoprotective effects of the encapsulated 
      probiotic in a rat model of bile duct ligation (BDL)-induced hepatic fibrosis. 
      APC microcapsules were fabricated using an extrusion technique and characterized 
      by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy 
      (FTIR) to confirm successful encapsulation. The survival of encapsulated and 
      non-encapsulated P. acidilactici was assessed in simulated gastrointestinal 
      fluids. For in vivo evaluation, forty-eight rats were randomly assigned to six 
      groups and treated for 28 days. Outcomes included serum bilirubin and liver 
      enzyme levels, hepatic oxidative stress markers, histopathological changes, and 
      expression of fibrosis- and inflammation-related genes measured by quantitative 
      reverse transcription PCR (RT-qPCR). Encapsulation significantly improved 
      probiotic viability in gastrointestinal conditions (5.15 +/- 0.21 vs. 2.05 +/- 0.35 
      log(1)(0) CFU/mL after two hours, P </= 0.05). In BDL rats, treatment with encapsulated 
      P. acidilactici led to significant reductions in serum bilirubin, liver enzymes, 
      and oxidative stress, alongside improved liver histology and favorable modulation 
      of gene expression compared to controls (P </= 0.05). These findings demonstrate 
      that APC encapsulation enhances the gastrointestinal stability of P. acidilactici 
      and supports its therapeutic potential against hepatic fibrosis.

      Its Anti-inflammatory Effects in Murine Macrophages.
LID - 10.1007/s12602-025-10628-w [doi]
AB  - To ascertain safety, the assessment of bacterial strains to be used as probiotics 
      needs rigorous and well-designed in vitro and in vivo studies. Here, the safety 
      of a GABA-producing Levilactobacillus brevis LAB6 MTCC 25662 was assessed using 
      in (silico, vitro and vivo) approaches. Firstly, the genomic analysis suggested 
      that LAB6 is non-pathogenic to humans, as it does not harbour the genes for 
      virulence, pathogenesis-related and horizontally transferable antimicrobial 
      resistance. LAB6 neither produces biogenic amines nor degrades mucin, has no 
      haemolytic activity and does not exert cytotoxicity on HEK-293 cells. In vivo 
      safety of LAB6 was assessed in acute, subacute and sub-chronic oral feeding 
      experiments following revised OECD guidelines 425, 407 and 408, respectively. 
      Histopathological, blood biochemical, haematological parameters, gut permeability 
      and oxidative stress levels were assessed. In vivo studies indicated that LAB6 
      did not negatively impact haematological markers or cause deleterious 
      histological alterations in the vital organs. The anti-inflammatory potential of 
      LAB6 in alleviating lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced inflammation in murine 
      macrophages was assessed in the presence of GABA(A) and GABA(B) receptor 
      antagonists. LAB6, owing to its GABA-producing ability, prevented LPS-induced 
      inflammation by reducing TNF-alpha, IL-6 and IL-1beta levels by 62.3%, 27.2% and 74.8%, 
      respectively. Antagonism of the GABA(A) receptor with bicuculline methiodide 
      (BMI) partially blunted the protective effects of LAB6, while GABA(B) antagonism 
      has no significant impact in curtailing its protective effects. Overall results 
      indicated that oral consumption of anti-inflammatory and GABA-producing LAB6 is 
      safe to test in human studies further.

TI  - Innovative Interventions: Postbiotics and Psychobiotics in Neurodegenerative 
      Disease Treatment.
LID - 10.1007/s12602-025-10632-0 [doi]
AB  - Neurodegenerative disorders, including Huntington's disease, Amyotrophic lateral 
      sclerosis, Alzheimer's disease, and Parkinson's disease, create more challenges 
      as the population gets older and there are no curative therapies available. 
      Recent advances in gut microbiome research have spotlighted postbiotics and 
      psychobiotics as innovative therapeutic strategies targeting the gut-brain axis 
      to alleviate neurodegenerative symptoms and slow disease progression. 
      Postbiotics, which are metabolites and cellular components released by probiotic 
      bacteria, and psychobiotics, a class of probiotics with potential mental health 
      benefits, offer novel approaches to neuroprotection. This chapter examines the 
      ways in which postbiotics and psychobiotics modulate inflammation, oxidative 
      stress, neurotrophic factors, and gut barrier integrity to provide 
      neuroprotective effects. We review scientific research that highlights the 
      efficacy of specific microbial strains and their metabolites in enhancing 
      cognitive function and reducing neurodegeneration. In addition, we explore the 
      consequences of diet and specific nutrition on strengthening the therapeutic 
      results of these medications. The purpose of this chapter is to provide a 
      detailed analysis of the existing data supporting the use of postbiotics and 
      psychobiotics in both the prevention and management of neurological diseases. By 
      integrating perspectives from microbiology, neurology, and clinical nutrition, we 
      highlight the potential of these interventions to enhance patient outcomes and 
      quality of life. In addition, we discuss the translational limitations and future 
      research approaches required to successfully transition these microbiome-based 
      treatments from the laboratory to clinical practice, emphasizing the importance 
      of a holistic and personalized approach in combating neurodegenerative diseases.

TI  - Is the gut microbiome of importance in fibromyalgia? A critical review of 
      emerging evidence.
PG  - 990-998
LID - 10.55563/clinexprheumatol/pmajsv [doi]
AB  - Fibromyalgia (FM) is a multifaceted chronic pain syndrome, predominantly 
      affecting women, and characterised by a constellation of symptoms including 
      diffuse musculoskeletal pain, fatigue, cognitive impairment and poor sleep 
      quality. Its complex pathophysiology likely involves genetic, environmental and 
      psychosocial factors. Recent studies have raised the possibility that the gut 
      microbiome may influence FM symptoms via the gut-brain axis, although this 
      hypothesis remains unconfirmed. This review aims to explore potential 
      associations between gut microbiome alterations, nutrition, and FM, with 
      particular attention to the limitations of current evidence. While certain 
      studies have reported differences in the gut microbiota composition of patients 
      with FM, these findings are preliminary and often derive from small, 
      heterogeneous cohorts. Likewise, faecal microbiota transplantation studies in 
      animals and limited human trials suggest a possible link to pain sensitivity, but 
      further validation is needed.Nutritional interventions, including prebiotics, 
      probiotics and specific dietary strategies, have shown early promise in 
      modulating gut microbiota and alleviating FM symptoms. Nutrients such as 
      magnesium, selenium and omega-3 fatty acids, as well as antioxidant compounds, 
      may influence pain and inflammation pathways, but definitive clinical 
      recommendations are lacking. Given the emerging nature of this field, larger and 
      better-controlled studies are required to clarify the role of the gut microbiome 
      and nutrition in FM. A multidisciplinary management strategy, integrating 
      nutritional approaches cautiously and based on individual profiles, may offer 
      benefits, although no standard therapeutic guidelines currently exist.

TI  - Glycosphingolipid synthesis is impaired in SLC35A2-CDG and improves with 
      galactose supplementation.
PG  - 257
LID - 10.1007/s00018-025-05759-w [doi]
AB  - SLC35A2-CDG is an X-linked congenital disorder of glycosylation (CDG), 
      characterized by defective UDP-galactose transport into the Golgi and endoplasmic 
      reticulum and consequent insufficient galactosylation of glycans. Clinically, 
      this translates into a range of predominantly neurological symptoms. Although the 
      pathomechanism of this disorder is not fully understood, oral galactose 
      supplementation has led to clinical and biochemical improvement in some patients. 
      Here, we show that protein glycosylation (N- and O-linked) was only minimally 
      disturbed in SLC35A2-CDG patient-derived fibroblasts. However, lipid 
      glycosylation was significantly impaired, with accumulation of glucosylceramide 
      and deficiency of digalactosylated glycosphingolipids (GSLs) and complex 
      gangliosides. Galactose supplementation increased UDP-galactose, its transport 
      into the Golgi, and improved deficient GSL synthesis through direct incorporation 
      of the provided galactose. This improved GSL homeostasis in all patient-derived 
      fibroblasts and in another SLC35A2 deficient cell model (CHO-Lec8). Additionally, 
      SLC35A2-CDG serum analysis identified hydroxylated GSLs, particularly GM3, as 
      potential disease biomarkers. Given the essential role of gangliosides in central 
      nervous system function, their deficiency is likely a key factor in the 
      neurological involvement of this disorder. These findings pave the way for new 
      nutritional therapies with GSL supplements and highlight the importance of 
      studying lipid glycosylation to better understand the complex pathophysiology of 
      CDG.

TI  - Effect of copper exposure on the silkworm Bombyx mori: Insights into the changes 
      of metabolism, gut microbial composition and gene expression.
LID - 10.1111/imb.13010 [doi]
AB  - Copper (Cu), a trace element with crucial roles in physiological processes, can 
      exert detrimental effects when imbalanced. Despite growing research on Cu's 
      impacts on biota, its effects on terrestrial organisms, particularly insects, at 
      environmental concentrations remain poorly understood. This study aims to 
      elucidate the mechanisms underlying Cu-induced damage in silkworms (Bombyx mori 
      L., 1758 (Lepidoptera: Bombycidae)) and identify potential targets to mitigate 
      such damage. Using an integrated approach of physiological, histopathological, 
      biochemical and multi-omics analyses, we investigated the effects of Cu exposure 
      throughout most of the silkworms' larval stage. Our findings reveal that Cu 
      exposure significantly hampers the growth and development of silkworms, evidenced 
      by reduced intestinal trehalose levels, compromised peritrophic membrane (PM) 
      structure in the midgut (MG) and altered composition and diversity of the 
      intestinal microbiota. Furthermore, Cu exposure leads to an increase in 
      pathogenic bacteria and a decrease in probiotics and induces inflammation and 
      apoptosis in the midgut and fatbody (FB) tissues. Biochemical and transcriptomic 
      analyses indicate that Cu disrupts nutrient metabolism and energy homeostasis, 
      resulting in decreased adenosine triphosphatase (ATP) levels. Chronic Cu exposure 
      activates the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signalling pathway, triggering abnormal apoptosis and 
      autophagy, altering detoxification processes, immune enzyme activities and gene 
      expression. This study provides novel insights into the mechanisms of Cu toxicity 
      in silkworms and establishes a foundation for identifying targets to reduce Cu's 
      biotoxicity, offering valuable data for managing Cu pollution in insects.

TI  - Effect of an oral inmunoenhanced formula on sarcopenia and quality of life in 
      ambulatory patients with cancer.
LID - 10.20960/nh.05654 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: cancer patients are a group of high risk of malnutrition and 
      sarcopenia. Inmunoenhanced oral nutritional supplements (ONS) can improve this 
      complex situation. OBJECTIVE: the objective of our study was to assess the 
      effectiveness of an inmunoenhanced oral nutritional supplements (ONS) on 
      sarcopenia and quality of life (QoL) in ambulatory patients with cancer and 
      malnutrition. MATERIAL AND METHODS: 158 ambulatory patients with cancer were 
      recruited. A biochemical, anthropometric, impedance measurement, nutritional 
      survey, muscle ultrasound and EQ5D quality of life test were performed before and 
      after 12 weeks of intervention with 2 bricks per day of an immunoenhanced ONS. 
      RESULTS: the mean age was 69.2 +/- 10.9 years (n = 158). At baseline, 43.7 % were 
      classified as severe malnutrition with GLIM criteria; following the intervention, 
      33.7 % were reclassified as severe malnutrition status (p = 0.013). After dietary 
      intervention, handgrip strength (1.7 +/- 0.3 kg; p = 0.02), proteins (0.7 +/- 0.2 
      g/dL; p = 0.01), albumin levels (0.8 +/- 0.2 g/dL; p = 0.03), skeletal muscle index 
      (5.4 +/- 0.1 kg/m2; p = 0.01), appendicular skeletal mass (3.2 +/- 0.3 kg/m2; p = 
      0.02) and appendicular skeletal mass index (2.5 +/- 0.3 kg/m2; p = 0.01) improved. 
      At the beginning of the study, 29.1 % of the patients presented according to the 
      EWGSOP2 criteria, which decreased to 20.9 % after nutritional treatment (p = 
      0.01). The overall EQ-5D index score did not demonstrate a significant 
      improvement following 12 weeks of supplementation. Analysis of the EQ-5D 
      dimensions showed a significant improvement in the percentages (""no problems"") 
      ofmobility dimension and usual activities dimensions. CONCLUSIONS: the use of an 
      inmunoenhanced ONS in real-world life study with patients with cancer shows a 
      beneficial effect on nutritional parameters, sarcopenia and quality of life.

      Umbrella Meta-Analysis.
LID - nuae190 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/nutrit/nuae190 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: Probiotics supplementation has many beneficial impacts on periodontitis 
      outcomes. OBJECTIVE: This umbrella meta-analysis evaluated the effectiveness of 
      probiotics in treating periodontitis, focusing on primary outcome measures, 
      including reductions in probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level 
      (CAL), bleeding on probing (BOP), plaque index (PI), gingival index (GI), and PDD 
      reduction in medium and deep pockets. DATA SOURCE: The Scopus, PubMed, Web of 
      Science, Embase, and Google Scholar online databases were searched up to January 
      2024. DATA EXTRACTION: All meta-analyses evaluating the impact of probiotics 
      supplementation on periodontitis outcomes were considered eligible. DATA 
      ANALYSIS: A random-effects model was employed to estimate the pooled results. 
      Subgroup and sensitivity analyses were conducted. The quality of the studies was 
      evaluated using the AMSTAR2 tool. Overall, 19 meta-analyses with 67 data sets 
      were included in this umbrella review. Our findings indicated that probiotics 
      supplementation significantly decreased BOP (effect size [ES]: -8.20; 95% CI: 
      -15.10 to -1.31; P = .02) and CAL after sensitivity analysis (ES: -0.52; 95% CI: 
      -0.75 to -0.28; P < .05). No other significant effect was observed on PPD, PI, 
      GI, or PDD reduction in medium and deep pockets. CONCLUSION: This umbrella 
      meta-analysis found that, during their treatment process, probiotics 
      supplementation may positively affect BOP and CAL in people with periodontitis.

AB  - There is much interest in the development of dietary supplements that selectively 
      promote the growth of beneficial gut bacteria. The selectivity of many candidate 
      prebiotics has, however, not been thoroughly investigated. Here, we evaluated 
      stimulation of the human gut microbiota by the disaccharide lactulose using an ex 
      vivo multimodal activity-based cell sorting approach. Incubation of human donor 
      stool with lactulose resulted in growth or stimulation of a restricted diversity 
      of bacterial genera, most prominently Bifidobacterium, Collinsella, and 
      Lactococcus. Physiological analysis of lactulose-responsive strains isolated by 
      Raman activated cell sorting revealed that most were capable of lactulose 
      degradation. Among these isolates, Lactococcus lactis could not degrade 
      lactulose, but its growth was boosted by co-cultivation with lactulose degraders. 
      This suggests that inter-species facilitation contributes to the lactulose 
      degradation niche. Moreover, we observed that lactulose selectively activates 
      metabolically important taxa, including health-associated genera such as 
      Faecalibacterium and Gemmiger(1,2,3), potentially indicating broader functional 
      effects beyond compositional changes. These results provide novel insights into 
      the physiology and ecology of lactulose utilization by the human gut microbiota 
      and underscore the potential of lactulose as a prebiotic dietary supplement.

      randomized clinical pilot study.
PG  - 320-327
LID - 10.22088/cjim.16.2.320 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Multiple myeloma (MM) is characterized by reduced circulating 
      adiponectin levels, a condition associated with various diseases such as diabetes 
      mellitus, obesity, cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and plasma dyscrasias. 
      Curcumin has been shown to inhibit adipogenesis and elevate serum adiponectin 
      levels. Notably, limited studies investigating the relationship between 
      adiponectin levels and curcumin supplementation in myeloma patients. This study 
      is to evaluate the efficacy curcumin supplements on increasing the levels of 
      adiponectin in myeloma patients. METHODS: Patients with myeloma were randomly to 
      melphalan, prednisone, curcumin (MPC) (n=17) and melphalan with prednisone (MP) 
      (n=16) groups. The MPC group was treated by melphalan 4 mg/m(2) and prednisone 40 
      mg/m(2) for 7 days (MP), and curcumin 8 grams daily for 28 days. The MP group 
      received MP and placebo. Subjects were followed-up every 28 days and a total of 
      four treatment cycles. Hemoglobin, albumin, white blood cell (WBC), platelets, 
      urea, creatinine, calcium, protein M, and adiponectin evaluated before and after 
      treatment. Mann Whitney test or the Independent T-test were used to analysis. 
      RESULTS: Total subject (24 subjects) completed the treatment. Serum adiponectin 
      levels after four treatment cycles in the MPC group were higher than in the MP 
      group [(mean, 12227.1+/-5748.3) vs (11365.4+/-9175.5), P = 0.78]. CONCLUSION: 
      Supplementing MP regimen with 8000 mg curcumin daily for 28 days increases the 
      serum adiponectin level after four treatment cycles in myeloma patients. This 
      research found that myeloma patients may benefit by taking curcumin 
      supplementation.

AB  - The community of microorganisms that colonize certain areas of the human body is 
      called microbiota. Microorganisms such as bacteria, fungi and viruses make up the 
      microbiota. The sum of the genomes of these microorganisms and microorganisms 
      refers to the microbiome. It has been shown that microbiota has important effects 
      such as protecting the organ from pathogens, contributing to metabolic functions 
      (such as vitamin synthesis, carbohydrate digestion) and providing 
      immunoregulation. Dysbiosis refers to compositional and functional changes in the 
      microbiota. At the beginning of the 21(st) century, numerous studies have 
      investigated the human microbiota and its imbalance in relation to various 
      diseases and found that dysbiosis is associated with many diseases. The aim of

AB  - BACKGROUND: IBS often appears as bloating, altered bowel patterns, and abdominal 
      pain (AP).Probiotics and SCFA may be useful in mucosal repair and symptom relief, 
      according to earlier research, however there is currently a lack of systematic 
      evidence supporting their therapeutic effectiveness across a variety of IBS 
      subtypes. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the impacts of probiotics on signs and 
      intestinal barrier function (IBF) in individuals with multiple IBS subtypes, and 
      evaluate the role of SCFA in this process. METHODS: A double-blind randomized 
      controlled trial (DBRCT) design was adopted. Using the Rome IV criteria, a total 
      of 120 individuals with IBS were randomised to either the probiotic group (PG) or 
      placebo group (PLG). The intervention lasted for 12 weeks with an additional 
      4-week follow-up. In addition to fecal SCFA (FSCFA) levels, intestinal 
      permeability (L/M ratio), tight junction proteins (TJP), serum/fecal inflammatory 
      markers, and adverse event occurrence, the primary endpoint (PEP) evaluated was 
      IBS Symptom Severity Scale (IBS-SSS) scores. Subgroup analysis was performed in 
      selected cases. RESULTS: In terms of symptom scores, there was a major 
      correlation among group and time (F=9.314, P<0.001), and repeated-measures ANOVA 
      showed that the PG's scores were considerably < than those of the control group 
      (CG) beginning in week 8 (all P<0.01). Levels of acetate, propionate, and 
      butyrate considerably increased after 12 weeks of intervention (all P<0.01). 
      Intestinal permeability and Occludin significantly improved at weeks 8 and 12 
      (all P<0.0167), while important differences in Claudin-1 and Zonulin appeared 
      only at week 12 (all P<0.0167). Inflammatory markers considerably decreased at 
      week 12 (all P<0.0167). There were no statistically significant differences in 
      adherence or adverse events (P>0.05). Reductions in symptom scores were 
      positively connected with an increase in SCFAs (r=0.43, P=0.002). Subgroup 
      analysis across multiple IBS subtypes indicated significant symptom relief at 
      week 12 for all subtypes (all P<0.05). CONCLUSION: Probiotics significantly 
      improved clinical symptoms in IBS patients of different subtypes by increasing 
      short-chain fatty acid levels, repairing the intestinal barrier, and reducing 
      inflammation.

AB  - Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a growing global health burden, with a prevalence of 
      over 52.55 million cases. Rising disability-adjusted life-years, increasing age, 
      and disparities in care have contributed to the worsening severity and mortality 
      of AF. Modifiable risk factors, such as hypertension, obesity, and diabetes 
      mellitus, are associated with alterations in gut microbiota, making the gut-heart 
      axis a potential therapeutic target. Gut dysbiosis influences AF pathogenesis 
      through inflammation, metabolic disruption, and autonomic dysfunction. Key 
      mechanisms include gut barrier dysfunction, short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) 
      depletion, lipopolysaccharides (LPS)-induced inflammation, and 
      ferroptosis-mediated atrial remodeling. Trimethylamine N-oxide, bile acids, and 
      tryptophan metabolites contribute to arrhythmogenic remodeling. Emerging evidence 
      suggests that dietary interventions, including prebiotics and probiotics, as well 
      as gut surveillance, may help mitigate AF progression. Clinical implications of 
      gut modulation in AF include personalized dietary strategies, microbiome 
      assessment through metagenomic sequencing, and targeted interventions such as 
      SCFA-based therapies and ferroptosis inhibition. Metabolite surveillance, 
      including LPS and indoxyl sulfate monitoring, may influence the effectiveness of 
      anticoagulant and antiarrhythmic therapy. Despite growing mechanistic evidence 
      linking gut dysbiosis to AF, clinical applications remain unexplored. This review 
      summarizes the current understanding of the gut microbiome's role in AF.

TI  - Exploring the gut microbiome's influence on cancer-associated anemia: Mechanisms, 
      clinical challenges, and innovative therapies.
PG  - 105375

AB  - BACKGROUND: Anemia is a prevalent and challenging complication in patients with 
      hematologic and solid malignancies, which stems from the direct effects of 
      malignancy, treatment-induced toxicities, and systemic inflammation. It affects 
      patients' survival, functional status, and quality of life profoundly. Recent 
      literature has highlighted the emerging role of the gut microbiome in the 
      pathogenesis of cancer-associated anemia. The gut microbiota, through its 
      intricate interplay with iron metabolism, inflammatory pathways, and immune 
      modulation, may either exacerbate or ameliorate anemia depending on its 
      composition, and functional integrity. Dysbiosis, characterized by disruption in 
      the gut microbial ecosystem, is very common in cancer patients. This microbial 
      imbalance is implicated in anemia causation through diminished iron absorption, 
      persistent low-grade inflammation, and suppression of erythropoiesis. AIM: To 
      consolidate current evidence regarding the interplay between gut microbiome and 
      anemia in the setting of malignancies. It aims to provide a detailed exploration 
      of the mechanistic links between dysbiosis and anemia, identifies unique 
      challenges associated with various cancer types, and evaluates the efficacy of 
      microbiome-focused therapies. Through this integrative approach, the review seeks 
      to establish a foundation for innovative clinical strategies aimed at mitigating 
      anemia and improving patient outcomes in oncology. METHODS: A literature search 
      was performed using multiple databases, including Google Scholar, PubMed, Scopus, 
      and Web of Science, using a combination of keywords and Boolean operators to 
      refine results. Keywords included ""cancer-associated anemia"", ""gut microbiome"", 
      ""intestinal microbiota"", ""iron metabolism"", ""gut dysbiosis"", ""short-chain fatty 
      acids"", ""hematopoiesis"", ""probiotics"", ""prebiotics"", and ""fecal microbiota 
      transplantation"". Articles published in English between 2000 and December 2024 
      were included, with a focus on contemporary and relevant findings. RESULTS: 
      Therapeutic strategies aimed at restoration of gut microbial homeostasis, such as 
      probiotics, prebiotics, dietary interventions, and fecal microbiota 
      transplantation (FMT), can inhibit anemia-causing pathways by enhancing microbial 
      diversity, suppressing detrimental flora, reducing systemic inflammation and 
      optimizing nutrient absorption. CONCLUSION: Gut dysbiosis causes anemia and 
      impairs response to chemotherapy in cancer patients. Microbiome-centered 
      interventions, such as probiotics, prebiotics, dietary modifications, and FMT, 
      have shown efficacy in restoring microbial balance, reducing inflammation, and 
      enhancing nutrient bioavailability. Emerging approaches, including engineered 
      probiotics and bacteriophage therapies, are promising precision-based, 
      customizable solutions for various microbiome compositions and imbalances. Future 
      research should focus on integrating microbiome-targeted strategies with 
      established anemia therapies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) symptoms are common in patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), with systematic review reporting an overall 
      pooled prevalence of 35-39% in patients with clinical remission. This subset of 
      patients reports a reduced quality of life and increased anxiety and depression. 
      A multi-strain probiotic (Symprove, Symprove Ltd, Farnham, United Kingdom) has 
      been shown to improve overall symptom severity in patients with IBS and is 
      associated with decreased intestinal inflammation in patients with ulcerative 
      colitis (UC), but not in Crohn's disease (CD). AIM: To ascertain whether this 
      multi-strain probiotic would be effective in an IBS/IBD overlap population. 
      METHODS: The treatment of symptoms in the absence of inflammation in inflammatory 
      bowel diseases trial was a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 
      a four-strain probiotic Symprove, containing Lactobacillus rhamnosus NCIMB 30174, 
      Lactobacillus plantarum NCIMB 30173, Lactobacillus acidophilus NCIMB 30175 and 
      Enterococcus faecium NCIMB 30176. The duration of the study was 3 months, at the 
      end of which IBS-Symptom Severity Score (IBS-SSS) was repeated. Primary Endpoint 
      was a 100-point reduction in IBS-SSS. RESULTS: 61 participants were randomized 
      into the intention-to-treat analysis. 45% of patients receiving the active agent 
      achieved the endpoint compared to 33% of those receiving placebo (P = 0.42). In 
      UC, 50% of patients receiving placebo achieved the endpoint compared to 44% of 
      those receiving the active agent (P = 1.00). In CD 45% of those receiving the 
      active agent achieved the endpoint compared to 29% of those receiving placebo (P 
      = 0.34). The mean change in IBS-SSS for patients receiving placebo was a 
      reduction of 61 points, compared to a reduction in 90 points for patients 
      receiving active agent (P = 0.31). There was no difference between the groups 
      with regard to IBD outcomes. CONCLUSION: Probiotics may represent a safe and 
      effective means of addressing the unmet clinical need for symptom relief in 
      patients with overlapping IBS and IBD, especially in those with CD.

AB  - Functional constipation (FC) in elderly individuals is a significant health issue 
      that adversely affects their quality of life, with recent studies indicating a 
      close relationship between this condition and gut microbiota dysbiosis. This 
      review aims to explore the role of the gut microbiota in FC in elderly 
      individuals, analyze the mechanisms of the gut-brain axis, and evaluate the 
      potential use of microecological agents, including probiotics and prebiotics, in 
      modulating the gut microbiota and alleviating constipation symptoms. By 
      integrating the latest research findings, this study seeks to provide new 
      perspectives and intervention strategies for the management of FC in elderly 
      individuals.

AB  - Primary immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune disorder characterized by 
      platelet destruction and impaired production, leading to bleeding risk. While 
      immunosuppressive therapies are standard, many patients experience relapses or 
      refractory disease, highlighting the need for novel approaches. Emerging evidence 
      suggests the gut microbiota plays a role in immune regulation, yet its impact on 
      ITP remains unclear. Dysbiosis has been linked to immune dysfunction in other 
      autoimmune diseases, but whether it drives or results from immune dysregulation 
      in ITP is debated. This review explores the gut-immune axis in ITP, focusing on 
      microbiota-driven immune modulation, cytokine signaling, and platelet 
      homeostasis. We assess microbiota-targeted interventions, including fecal 
      microbiota transplantation (FMT), probiotics, and dietary modifications, while 
      addressing key controversies and knowledge gaps. Advances in microbiome 
      sequencing and artificial intelligence may facilitate personalized interventions. 
      Standardizing microbiota-based diagnostics and validating their efficacy in 
      clinical trials are crucial for their integration into ITP management. Bridging 
      these gaps may lead to microbiota-driven strategies that enhance immune 
      regulation and improve patient outcomes.

AB  - Folic acid supplementation is crucial for the health of both mother and newborn. 
      This study investigated Saudi women's awareness, attitudes, and adherence 
      regarding folic acid supplementation. National surveys were conducted across 
      Saudi Arabia from January 1 to February 28, 2025. A validated online 
      questionnaire was presented to female participants to assess socio-demographics, 
      knowledge, and attitudes on folic acid usage. Data analysis was performed using 
      Microsoft Excel, with results displayed as numerical values and percentages. 60% 
      of participants acknowledged the significance of folic acid during gestation. A 
      fair proportion recognized food sources of folic acid, although they 
      misinterpreted the timing of supplementation. A substantial majority (83.5%) 
      favored supplements and natural dietary sources, whilst 10.7% depended only on 
      prescribed supplements. Just under half (45%) reported healthcare personnel to 
      facilitate adherence, whereas 39.1% cited inadequate knowledge as an obstacle to 
      adherence. Despite modest awareness of folic acid importance, there remain 
      deficits in knowledge and obstacles in adherence among Saudi women. Improving 
      educational programs and integrating folic acid counseling into normal healthcare 
      practices are essential for ensuring consistent supplementation and enhancing 
      maternal and fetal health outcomes.

AB  - The intestine is an important segment of the gastrointestinal tract, which is 
      involved in complex processes that maintain the body's normal homeostasis. It 
      hosts a vast, diverse, and dynamic microbial community called the gut microbiota, 
      which develops from birth. It has been observed that the gut microbiota is 
      involved in essential physiological processes, including the development of the 
      central nervous system via the gut microbiota-brain axis. An alteration of the 
      gut microbiota can lead to serious health problems, including defective 
      neurodevelopment. Thus, this paper aims to highlight the most recent advances in 
      studies that focus on the link between the gut microbiota and the evolution of 
      neurodevelopmental diseases in children. Currently, studies show that the use of 
      drugs that stimulate and restore the gut microbiota (e.g., probiotics and 
      prebiotics) have the potential to alleviate some of the symptoms associated with 
      conditions such as Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention Deficit Hyperactivity 
      Disorder, Tic Disorder, Tourette Syndrome, epilepsy, and Down Syndrome. In 
      addition, due to the challenges associated with drug administration in children, 
      as well as the widespread shortage of medications intended for pediatric use, 
      researchers are working on the development of new delivery systems. 
      Liposome-based systems or solid lipid nanoparticles have been safely used for 
      drug delivery in various pediatric conditions, which may also indicate their 
      potential for use in the administration of microbiota-modulating therapies.

      A Focus on Parkinson's and Alzheimer's Disease.
LID - 890 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph18060890 [doi]
AB  - The endocannabinoid system (ECS) is a vital biological network essential for 
      maintaining homeostasis and supporting various physiological functions. It 
      comprises cannabinoid receptors, endogenous lipid-based ligands, known as 
      endocannabinoids, as well as metabolic enzymes and associated proteins 
      responsible for regulating their levels within tissues. The ECS plays a central 
      role in modulating processes involving the central nervous system (CNS). Recent 
      studies have highlighted its antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, and neuroprotective 
      properties. The therapeutic potential of cannabinoids, particularly 
      phytocannabinoids derived from plants, has attracted significant attention in 
      medical and pharmaceutical research. This interest has grown in parallel with the 
      increasing availability of cannabinoid-based food supplements on the 
      pharmaceutical market. Given the complexity of the ECS and its broad range of 
      interactions, the discovery of this system has spurred extensive investigations 
      into the use of cannabinoids for various health conditions. In this review, we 
      examine recent preclinical evidence supporting the use of phytocannabinoids in 
      the context of neurodegenerative diseases, particularly in Alzheimer's disease 
      and Parkinson's disease. Targeting the ECS through phytocannabinoid-based 
      pharmacological modulation offers a promising therapeutic strategy for these 
      neurological disorders. Among these compounds, cannabidiol has emerged as a key 
      focus of research due to its multifaceted effects and favorable safety profile. 
      Nonetheless, continued investigation is necessary to clarify its mechanisms of 
      action, and to develop effective, evidence-based clinical applications.

TI  - Recent HPLC-UV Approaches for Cannabinoid Analysis: From Extraction to Method 
      Validation and Quantification Compliance.
LID - 786 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph18060786 [doi]
AB  - Since the 1990s, cannabis has experienced a gradual easing of access 
      restrictions, accompanied by the expansion of its legalization and 
      commercialization. This shift has led to the proliferation of cannabis-based 
      products, available as cosmetics, food supplements, and pharmaceutical dosage 
      forms. Consequently, there has been a growing demand for reliable and 
      reproducible extraction techniques alongside precise analytical methods for 
      detecting and quantifying cannabinoids, both of which are essential for ensuring 
      consumer safety and product quality. Given the variability in extraction and 
      quantification techniques across laboratories, significant attention has recently 
      been directed toward method validation. Validated methods ensure precise 
      cannabinoid measurement in cannabis-based products, supporting compliance with 
      dosage guidelines and legal limits. Thus, this review highlights recent 
      advancements in these areas, with a particular focus on High-Performance Liquid 
      Chromatography (HPLC) coupled with Ultraviolet (UV) detection, as it is 
      considered the gold standard for cannabinoid analysis included in cannabis 
      monographs present in several pharmacopeias. The research focused on studies 
      published between January 2022 and December 2024, sourced from PubMed, Scopus, 
      and Web of Science, that employed an HPLC-UV analytical technique for the 
      detection of phytocannabinoids. Additionally, the review examines cannabinoid 
      extraction techniques and the validation methodologies used by the authors in the 
      selected papers. Notably, ultrasound extraction has emerged as the most widely 
      utilized technique across various matrices, with Deep Eutectic Solvents (DESs) 
      offering a promising, efficient, and environmentally friendly extraction 
      alternative. Analytical chromatographic separations continue to be predominantly 
      conducted using C18 reversed-phase columns. Nevertheless, in recent years, 
      researchers have explored various stationary phases, particularly to achieve the 
      enantioseparation of cannabinoids.

TI  - Effects of 12 Weeks of Chromium, Phyllanthus emblica Fruit Extract, and Shilajit 
      Supplementation on Markers of Cardiometabolic Health, Fitness, and Weight Loss in 
      Men and Women with Risk Factors to Metabolic Syndrome Initiating an Exercise and 
      Diet Intervention: A Randomized Double-Blind, Placebo-Controlled Trial.
LID - 2042 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17122042 [doi]
AB  - Background: Exercise and nutritional interventions are often recommended to help 
      manage risk related to metabolic syndrome (MetSyn). The co-ingestion of 
      Phyllanthus emblica (PE) with trivalent chromium (Cr) has been purported to 
      improve the bioavailability of chromium and enhance endothelial function, reduce 
      platelet aggregation, and help manage blood glucose as well as lipid levels. 
      Shilajit (SJ) has been reported to have anti-inflammatory, adaptogenic, 
      immunomodulatory, and lipid-lowering properties. This study evaluated whether 
      dietary supplementation with Cr, PE, and SJ, or PE alone, during an exercise and 
      diet intervention may help individuals with risk factors to MetSyn experience 
      greater benefits. Methods: In total, 166 sedentary men and women with at least 
      two markers of metabolic syndrome participated in a randomized, 
      placebo-controlled, parallel-arm, and repeated-measure intervention study, of 
      which 109 completed the study (48.6 +/- 10 yrs., 34.2 +/- 6 kg/m(2), 41.3 +/- 7% fat). 
      All volunteers participated in a 12-week exercise program (supervised resistance 
      and endurance exercise 3 days/week with walking 10,000 steps/day on non-training 
      days) and were instructed to reduce energy intake by -5 kcals/kg/d. Participants 
      were matched by age, sex, BMI, and body mass for the double-blind and randomized 
      supplementation of a placebo (PLA), 500 mg of PE (PE-500), 1000 mg/d of PE 
      (PE-1000), 400 microg of trivalent chromium (Cr) with 6 mg of PE and 6 mg of SJ 
      (Cr-400), or 800 microg of trivalent chromium with 12 mg of PE and 12 mg of SJ 
      (Cr-800) once a day for 12 weeks. Data were obtained at 0, 6, and 12 weeks of 
      supplementation, and analyzed using general linear model multivariate and 
      univariate analyses with repeated measures, pairwise comparisons, and mean 
      changes from the baseline with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Results: Compared 
      to PLA responses, there was some evidence (p < 0.05 or approaching significance, 
      p > 0.05 to p < 0.10) that PE and/or Cr with PE and SJ supplementation improved 
      pulse wave velocity, flow-mediated dilation, platelet aggregation, insulin 
      sensitivity, and blood lipid profiles while promoting more optimal changes in 
      body composition, strength, and aerobic capacity. Differences among groups were 
      more consistently seen at 6 weeks rather than 12 weeks. While some benefits were 
      seen at both dosages, greater benefits were more consistently observed with 
      PE-1000 and Cr-800 ingestion. Conclusions: The results suggest that PE and Cr 
      with PE and SJ supplementation may enhance some exercise- and diet-induced 
      changes in markers of health in overweight individuals with at least two risk 
      factors to MetSyn. Registered clinical trial #NCT06641596.

TI  - Beyond Folate: The Emerging Role of Maternal Vitamin B12 in Neural Tube 
      Development.
LID - 2040 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17122040 [doi]
AB  - Background/Objectives: Folic acid (FA) supplementation can effectively reduce the 
      occurrence of neural tube defects (NTDs). Vitamin B12 is involved in folate 
      metabolism; however, studies have not reached a definitive conclusion on the 
      association between vitamin B12 and NTDs independent of folate levels. A 
      systematic review and meta-analysis were performed to summarize existing research 
      and investigate the effect of vitamin B12 on NTDs. Methods: Studies were 
      systematically searched in PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Cochrane, 
      published before 1 March 2024. Standardized mean difference (SMD) with 95% 
      confidence interval (CI) was employed to assess the association between maternal 
      vitamin B12 in blood and NTDs. Results: A total of 38 studies were included, with 
      a total of 2316 NTDs and 4298 controls, covering 14 countries worldwide. Compared 
      with the non-NTD group, the NTD group exhibited a lower vitamin B12 level [SMD = 
      -0.23, 95% CI (-0.32, -0.14), p < 0.001, I(2) = 58.3%] with a statistically 
      significant difference. Additionally, there was a significant association between 
      maternal vitamin B12 concentration and NTDs when there was no significant 
      difference in folate between the NTD and control groups [SMD: -0.19, 95% CI 
      (-0.28, -0.10)]. Conclusions: Vitamin B12 supplement is also essential for the 
      prevention of NTDs besides folic acid. Monitoring vitamin B12 concentration among 
      pregnant women and considering appropriate supplementation with a combination of 
      vitamin B12 and folic acid could be explored.

LID - 10.3390/nu17122033 [doi]
AB  - Introduction: The purpose of this study was to evaluate effects of post-exercise 
      protein supplementation with combined resistance and interval training on total 
      insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) concentration, strength (3RM), and body 
      composition (DXA) in untrained pre-menopausal women. Methods: Twenty-seven women 
      (33.6 +/- 9.2 years, 69.4 +/- 12.4 kg, 25.5 +/- 3.7 kg/m(2)) were randomised into a 
      control (CON) or moderate protein group (PRO) (3 g, 24 g, resp.) and completed 
      twelve weeks of upper-body resistance (2x/week) and high-intensity interval cycle 
      training (3x/week). Linear mixed-effects model analyses were conducted. Results: 
      PRO had a greater daily protein intake (5.0 +/- 16.6 g, 20.5 +/- 13.9 g, CON, PRO, 
      resp., p = 0.025), with no change in IGF-1 (-6.0 +/- 27.7 microg/L, -2.1 +/- 27.8 microg/L, 
      CON, PRO, resp., p = 0.920). Total lean mass increased (0.84 +/- 0.80 kg, 0.56 +/- 
      1.4 kg, CON, PRO, resp., p = 0.009), and all strength measures increased in both 
      groups (19-113%, p < 0.05). Conclusions: Untrained women can increase strength 
      and lean mass over twelve weeks of combined resistance and interval training. 
      Post-exercise protein supplementation had little effect, despite increasing 
      protein intake by ~20 g/day in the PRO group. IGF-1 was not associated with any 
      outcome measure.

TI  - Assessment of Determinants of Dietary Vitamin D Intake in a Polish National 
      Sample of Male Adolescents.
LID - 2024 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17122024 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Calcitriol, the active form of vitamin D, has a broad 
      physiological effect, and its deficiency has been identified as a risk factor for 
      many diseases. This study aimed to analyze the dietary intake of vitamin D and 
      the factors determining its intake among Polish post-primary school students. The 
      data obtained were then related to the dietary recommendations for the Polish 
      population. METHODS: The study was conducted on a nationwide sample of 3257 male 
      adolescents (aged 14-20 years) recruited from all macroregions of Poland. Dietary 
      vitamin D intake (dVDi) was assessed using the Vitamin D Estimation Only-Food 
      Frequency Questionnaire (VIDEO-FFQ). RESULTS: The median dietary intake of 
      vitamin D was 4.36 microg daily. This value was below the recommended intake of 15 microg 
      of vitamin D, according to Polish standards, in almost 80% of the study group. 
      The observed dietary vitamin D intake bellow the recommended level ranged from 
      35.5% of students attending schools in the North-Western macroregion to 93.7% in 
      the Central macroregion, from 45.4% of students attending schools located in the 
      countryside to 92.7% in big cities, from 85.3% among underweight students to 
      76.7% of obese students, over 77% in both age groups (14-17 and 18-20 years old), 
      and over 78% in both groups: supplementing and not supplementing vitamin D. Fish 
      and fish products provided the highest vitamin D (38.7%), while cereal products 
      and fats provided the lowest (4.49% and 4.35%, respectively). The highest amounts 
      of vitamin D were provided by salmon, rainbow trout, herring, and eel (fish 
      species containing 7-15 microg of vitamin D in 100 g of product), and halibut, 
      mackerel, brook trout, sole, and tuna (fish species containing 1.05-4 microg of 
      vitamin D in 100 g of product), and these fish were consumed in the largest 
      quantities by male adolescents. Dietary vitamin D intake was notably higher in 
      adolescents from the North-Western macroregion of Poland (median: 50.57 vs. 
      3.72-5.18 microg daily for other macroregions), those attending schools in the 
      countryside (median: 49.49 vs. 3.97-4.39 microg daily for other locations of the 
      school), those with a normal body weight (median: 4.59 vs. 3.38 microg daily for 
      adolescents with underweight), and those who took vitamin D supplements (median: 
      4.71 vs. 4.06 microg daily for adolescents not supplemented with vitamin D). However, 
      the results showed that dVDi was not dependent on age. CONCLUSIONS: The study 
      results indicate that low dVDi among Polish male adolescents can be attributed to 
      the limited supply of vitamin D from dietary sources, especially fish and fish 
      products. The necessity for interventions has been identified, including 
      nutritional education on the role of vitamin D and its sources in the diet.

TI  - Rewiring Mood: Precision Psychobiotics as Adjunct or Stand-Alone Therapy in 
      Depression Using Insights from 19 Randomized Controlled Trials in Adults.
LID - 2022 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17122022 [doi]
AB  - Background: Depression is a leading contributor to global disability, with a 
      large proportion of patients showing inadequate responses to conventional 
      antidepressants. Probiotic bacteria with psychotropic potential seem to be an 
      emerging treatment option, either alone or in conjunction with depression symptom 
      management. Objective: To critically review the Randomized Clinical Trials (RCTs) 
      whose primary focus was to evaluate the efficacy of probiotics/psychobiotics to 
      ameliorate depression status, quantified via validated psychometric tools. 
      Methods: A comprehensive literature search of the PubMed and Scopus databases 
      (January 2014-January 2025) was conducted to identify RCTs with the primary aim 
      of improving depression status in adults taking probiotics in comparison to those 
      taking a well-defined placebo. Results: Nineteen RCTs met the inclusion criteria, 
      with all demonstrating a significant amelioration of depression status after 
      probiotic/psychobiotic treatment, taken either as a stand-alone treatment [n = 5] 
      or as an adjunctive treatment to antidepressant therapy [n = 10]. However, only 
      in 14 studies was a significant improvement achieved at the end of treatment over 
      a placebo, which also showed an improvement against the baseline. In total, 7 out 
      of 10 studies with probiotics as an add-on therapy and 7 out of the 9 with 
      probiotics, either as a monotherapy or with a different percentage also taking 
      antidepressants, exhibited a significant amelioration of depression status 
      against placebo treatment. Conclusions: Probiotics, particularly multi-strain 
      preparations and certain well-characterized single strains, seem to be noticeably 
      beneficial in alleviating depressive symptoms in adults. However, there is an 
      urgent need for large-scale randomized clinical trials with well-defined specific 
      psychobiotic strains in order to confirm the most effective strains.

TI  - Maternal Diet Quality and Multivitamin Intake During Pregnancy Interact in the 
      Association with Offspring Neurodevelopment at 2 Years of Age.
LID - 2020 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17122020 [doi]
AB  - Objective: To comprehensively evaluate the interaction between diet quality and 
      multivitamin intake during pregnancy on offspring neurodevelopment. Methods: This 
      analysis was grounded in mother-child dyads from the 3D Cohort Study in Quebec, 
      Canada. Among the 2366 participants initially enrolled in the 3D study, 1535 
      women successfully completed the 3-day food record during 20-24 weeks of 
      gestation. A Canadian adaptation of the Healthy Eating Index (HEI-C) 2010 was 
      used to quantify diet quality. The total HEI-C score was dichotomized into low 
      and high diet quality by median split. Cognitive and motor development in 
      childhood were assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant and Toddler 
      Development, Third Edition (Bayley-III). Language abilities were measured using 
      the toddler short-form version of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development 
      Inventories (MCDI) questionnaire, administered in either English or French. After 
      excluding participants with missing covariate data, cognitive, motor, and 
      language development scores at 2 years of age were available for 1066, 1040, and 
      981 children, respectively. Multiple linear regression models were employed to 
      calculate adjusted effect estimates. The interaction on an additive scale was 
      assessed by incorporating a product term into the linear regression model. 
      Results: Statistically significant interactions were detected between diet 
      quality and multivitamin intake in relation to the cognitive and language 
      development outcomes of the offspring (interaction p-values were 0.018 and 0.023, 
      respectively). The lowest cognitive and language scores were observed in the 
      group of women who neither took multivitamins nor maintained a high-quality diet. 
      Among women not taking multivitamins, a high-quality diet was associated with 
      improved offspring cognitive and language scores (mean difference [95% CI] = 4.2 
      [0.1, 8.2], p = 0.04; and 11.3 [3.1, 19.5], p = 0.01, respectively). However, 
      among women taking multivitamins, no such associations were identified. 
      Conversely, in participants with a low-quality diet, multivitamin intake was 
      associated with a 3.0-point increase in cognitive composite scores (95% CI: 0.3, 
      5.8, p = 0.03), but this was not the case for those with a high-quality diet. No 
      statistically significant interactions were observed between maternal diet 
      quality and multivitamin intake for motor development outcomes. Conclusions: 
      Adequate nutritional supply during pregnancy, achieved either through a 
      high-quality diet or multivitamin supplementation, is fundamental for the 
      neurodevelopment of children.

TI  - From Fish Oil to Resolution: A Narrative Review on the Potential of SPM-Enriched 
      Marine Oil for Exercise-Induced Muscle Damage Recovery.
LID - 2014 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17122014 [doi]
AB  - Exercise-induced muscle damage (EIMD) initiates an inflammatory response that is 
      essential for tissue repair. However, when prolonged or excessive, this response 
      can impair recovery and muscular performance. Specialized pro-resolving mediators 
      (SPMs), derived from the metabolism of omega-3 (n-3) polyunsaturated fatty acids 
      (PUFAs), facilitate the resolution of inflammation without causing 
      immunosuppression. Evidence from preclinical studies indicates that SPM 
      administration accelerates muscle repair and functional recovery by enhancing the 
      clearance of apoptotic cells, suppressing pro-inflammatory signaling and 
      modulating macrophage polarization. However, translation to human applications 
      remains limited as commercially available SPM-enriched marine oils do not contain 
      active SPMs but rather their monohydroxylated precursors, including 
      14-Hydroxy-Docosahexaenoic Acid (14-HDHA), 17-Hydroxy-Docosahexaenoic Acid 
      (17-HDHA), and 18-Hydroxy-Eicosapentaenoic Acid (18-HEPE) in addition to low 
      doses of the n-3 PUFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid 
      (DHA). Furthermore, the variable increases in circulating SPM concentrations as a 
      result of dietary intake of EPA and DHA, whether from fish or fish oil 
      supplements, and the wide diversity of SPM molecules (many of which remain under 
      investigation), highlight the complexity of their structural and functional 
      networks. While advances in lipidomics have identified SPMs and their pathway 
      intermediates in human biological samples, further research is needed to 
      determine optimal dosing strategies, delivery mechanisms, and the real impact of 
      SPM-enriched marine oil on athletic performance and recovery. This narrative 
      review examines the biological rationale and current evidence surrounding 
      SPM-enriched marine oil supplementation and its potential to enhance muscle 
      recovery following EIMD. By synthesizing findings from preclinical and human 
      studies, the potential of SPM-enriched supplementation as a novel tool for 
      optimizing performance recovery in athletic populations is reviewed to inform 
      future research directions.

      and Magnesium Levels in Athletes.
LID - 2010 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17122010 [doi]
AB  - Background/Objectives: To evaluate the concentrations of trace elements in tear 
      fluid among athletes using particle-induced X-ray emission (PIXE), and to assess 
      the associations with gender, sports intensity, and nutritional supplement 
      intake. Methods: In this cohort study, 84 athletes engaged in high- or 
      low-intensity sports completed a demographic and supplement-use questionnaire. 
      Tear samples were collected using Schirmer strips and analyzed for elemental 
      composition with PIXE, a high-sensitivity technique suited for small biological 
      samples. Multivariate and nonparametric statistical analyses were used to compare 
      groups. Results: There were 46 males and 38 females, aged 17-63 years (mean 30.21 
      years). Tear phosphorus, potassium, and sulfur concentrations were higher in 
      women than men and higher in women participating in low-intensity compared to 
      high-intensity sports. Tear concentrations of magnesium were higher in men 
      participating in high-intensity sports compared to low-intensity sports. They 
      were higher in men than women regardless of supplement intake. Iron 
      concentrations were higher in men than women only when neither group was taking 
      supplements. Smoking had a slight inverse relationship to iron values. Iron 
      levels were particularly high in men participating in intense sports and low in 
      smokers. Magnesium supplements were associated with raised magnesium levels in 
      tears. Conclusions: This study demonstrates an association between trace element 
      levels in human tears and gender, sports intensity, and food supplement intake. 
      PIXE enables the evaluation of trace element concentration in tears, which may 
      serve as potential biomarkers for the clinical assessment of athletes' health.

TI  - An Adapted Cardioprotective Diet with or Without Phytosterol and/or Krill Oil 
      Supplementation in Familial Hypercholesterolemia: Results of a Pilot Randomized 
      Clinical Trial.
LID - 2008 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17122008 [doi]
AB  - Background/Objectives: Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an increasingly 
      common inherited disorder that increases cardiovascular risk. Despite the 
      importance of lifestyle interventions, adherence to a healthy diet among 
      individuals with FH remains suboptimal. This pilot, multicenter, double-blind, 
      placebo-controlled randomized trial aimed to evaluate the feasibility and 
      preliminary effects of a culturally adapted cardioprotective diet (DICA-FH), 
      alone or in combination with phytosterol and/or krill oil supplementation, on 
      lipid parameters in Brazilian adults with probable or definitive FH. Methods: 
      Between May and August 2023, 58 participants were enrolled across nine Brazilian 
      centers and randomized (1:1:1:1) into four groups: DICA-FH + phytosterol placebo 
      + krill oil placebo; DICA-FH + phytosterol 2 g/day + krill oil placebo; DICA-FH + 
      phytosterol placebo + krill oil 2 g/day; and DICA-FH + phytosterol 2 g/day + 
      krill oil 2 g/day. Interventions lasted 120 days. The primary outcomes were mean 
      low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-c) and lipoprotein(a) (Lp[a]) levels, as 
      well as adherence to treatment at follow-up. Secondary outcomes included mean 
      levels of other lipids, frequency of adverse events, and assessment of protocol 
      implementation components. All data were presented separately for the allocation 
      groups: phytosterol vs. placebo and krill oil vs. placebo. Results: Mean age was 
      54.5 +/- 13.7 years, and 58.6% were women. Both adherence to protocol (91.8% 
      attendance; 79.1% investigational product intake) and retention (86.2%) were 
      high. No significant differences between groups were found for LDL-c or Lp(a). 
      However, regardless of allocation to active supplementation or placebo, a 
      significant reduction in Lp(a) concentrations was observed following the DICA-FH 
      intervention (median difference: -3.8 mg/dL [interquartile range: -7.5 to -1.2]; 
      p < 0.01). Significant reductions in oxidized LDL (LDL-ox) and LDL-ox/LDL-c ratio 
      were also observed in the overall sample (p < 0.01). Although not statistically 
      significant, all groups showed improvements in diet quality after 120 days. No 
      serious adverse events related to the interventions were reported. Additionally, 
      most protocol implementation components were successfully achieved. Conclusions: 
      The DICA-FH strategy, with or without supplementation, was safe and 
      well-tolerated. Although not powered to detect clinical efficacy (which is 
      acceptable in exploratory pilot trials), the study supports the feasibility of a 
      larger trial and highlights the potential of dietary interventions in the 
      management of HF.

TI  - Inositols and Bone Health: Potential Therapeutic Applications in Osteoporosis 
      Prevention and Treatment.
LID - 1999 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17121999 [doi]
AB  - The mechanisms underlying the disruption of bone balance are well known. To date, 
      several possible treatments exist for osteoporosis, mostly based on inhibition of 
      bone resorption. However, as osteoporosis is a disease that causes significant 
      fragility, it merits a proactive prevention-based approach, which identifies risk 
      factors, such as nutritional deficiencies, during the preosteoporotic stage. In 
      this context, nutraceuticals may find application in delaying the onset of 
      osteoporosis and prior to the need for pharmaceutical invention. The beneficial 
      effects of inositol supplementation have been extensively studied in 
      endocrinology and gynecology; herein, we discuss the potential of inositols in 
      the prevention of osteoporosis, highlighting the link with bone metabolism and 
      possible future applications.

TI  - Optimizing Body Composition During Weight Loss: The Role of Amino Acid 
      Supplementation.
LID - 2000 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17122000 [doi]
AB  - Background/Objectives: Weight loss interventions in individuals with overweight 
      or obesity result in reductions in both fat mass and lean body mass (LBM). While 
      fat loss is the primary therapeutic target, preserving LBM may have favorable 
      health implications. This narrative review evaluates the role of amino acid 
      supplementation, including essential amino acids (EAAs) and branched-chain amino 
      acids (BCAAs), in supporting the preservation of LBM during weight loss induced 
      by lifestyle interventions, pharmacotherapy, or bariatric surgery. Methods: This 
      is a narrative review of preclinical and clinical studies examining the effects 
      of amino acid supplementation during calorie restriction on body composition and, 
      when available, functional outcomes. A comprehensive search was conducted in the 
      PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science databases. Results: Evidence suggests that EAA 
      and peptide-based supplementation may help preserve LBM during periods of reduced 
      energy intake, particularly when protein intake from whole foods is limited. 
      Benefits appear more consistent when supplementation is combined with resistance 
      exercise. BCAA supplementation alone has shown variable effects, especially in 
      sedentary individuals or when total protein intake is already sufficient. 
      Anabolic resistance associated with obesity may attenuate the muscle protein 
      synthesis response to dietary amino acids. Conclusions: Amino acid 
      supplementation may support the maintenance of LBM during weight loss, 
      particularly under conditions of low protein intake or in conjunction with 
      exercise. Further research is needed to determine the clinical significance of 
      LBM changes and identify optimal supplementation strategies.

TI  - Fermented Fruits, Vegetables, and Legumes in Metabolic Syndrome: From Traditional 
      Use to Functional Foods and Medical Applications.
LID - 1989 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17121989 [doi]
AB  - Fermentation has been used for centuries to preserve food and to obtain products 
      with new, attractive sensory characteristics. Fermented products are a source of 
      dietary fiber, vitamins, bioactive compounds, and probiotic bacteria with 
      health-promoting properties. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the 
      effects of fermented fruits, vegetables, and legumes on metabolic disturbances 
      characterizing metabolic syndrome (MetS). Furthermore, the chemical composition, 
      microbial communities, and molecular mechanisms of action of fermented plant 
      foods are discussed. Fermented fruits and vegetables, including table olives, 
      caper fruits, and kimchi, contain polyphenols and probiotic bacteria, which are 
      beneficial in terms of obesity and impaired glucose and lipid metabolism. 
      Fermented legumes are a valuable source of bioactive peptides and isoflavone 
      aglycones. Among fermented soybean products, natto stands out due to the presence 
      of gamma-polyglutamic acid, which improves glucose tolerance and the lipid profile, 
      and nattokinase, an enzyme that acts as an angiotensin-converting enzyme 
      inhibitor. Potential future studies focused on developing functional fermented 
      foods and easy-to-use supplements based on fermented plant products are 
      suggested.

TI  - Effects of Hawthorn Fruit Supplementation on Facial Skin Phenotypes and Leukocyte 
      Telomere Length Stratified by TERT Polymorphisms.
LID - 1983 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17121983 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled intervention study 
      aimed to evaluate whether hawthorn fruit (HF) supplementation can influence 
      facial skin phenotypes and leukocyte telomere length (TL) and whether these 
      effects differ by genetic polymorphisms related to TL. PARTICIPANTS/METHODS: 
      Among 41 male and female adults aged 25-75 years who participated in the study, 
      36 completed initial and follow-up examinations over 6 months. The HF 
      supplementation group (n = 17) was instructed to take a powdered HF supplement 
      (900 mg/day), while controls (n = 19) were to take a cornstarch placebo (900 
      mg/day). Facial skin phenotypes, including pigmentation, pores, hydration, 
      wrinkles, and elasticity, were measured before and after the intervention, and 
      changes in these phenotype scores were calculated. Sequencing of telomerase 
      reverse transcriptase (TERT) polymorphisms, such as rs7705526 (C>A) and rs2853669 
      (A>G), was conducted. RESULTS: The HF supplementation group exhibited 
      significantly improved hydration scores compared to the control group; the mean 
      changes (follow-up measure-baseline measure) [standard deviation] in hydration 
      scores over 6 months were 1.71 [8.18] and -3.00 [8.42] for the supplementation 
      group and control group, respectively (p < 0.05) (Cohen's d = 0.57). However, 
      changes in other phenotypes and leukocyte TL were similar between groups. The 
      genotype-specific analysis revealed that the improvement of hydration state was 
      most noticeable among carriers with the CC genotype of rs7705526 (p < 0.05) 
      (Cohen's d = 1.50) and that the HF supplementation group exhibited reduced 
      wrinkle scores while the control group showed increased scores among carriers of 
      the AA genotype of rs2853669 (p < 0.05) (Cohen's d = 1.40). In correlation 
      analysis for all participants, hydration scores were positively correlated with 
      leukocyte TL (Spearman correlation coefficient: 0.36; p < 0.05). CONCLUSIONS: 
      These findings suggest that HF consumption may have potential anti-skin-aging 
      effects. Future studies may need to elucidate the biological mechanisms 
      underlying these effects.

TI  - Vitamin B3 Ameliorates Sleep Duration and Quality in Clinical and Pre-Clinical 
      Studies.
LID - 1982 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17121982 [doi]
AB  - NAD(+) is a fundamental molecule participating as a redox cofactor in several 
      metabolic reactions and has a neuroprotective role associated with oxidate 
      stress. Despite its critical role, NAD(+) levels sharply decline with age, 
      contributing to the pathogenesis of aging-related diseases. Supplementation with 
      nicotinamide riboside (NR), also known as a form of vitamin B3, a biochemical 
      precursor of NAD(+), may replenish this depletion. Background/Objectives: 
      Mounting evidence suggests that dietary supplementation with NR, a form of 
      vitamin B3 and a biochemical precursor of NAD(+), enhances NAD(+) bioavailability 
      and prevents the detrimental effects on sleep, cognitive function, mitochondrial 
      function, and insulin sensitivity. However, there is a paucity of studies focused 
      on how NR administration affects sleep patterns. This narrative review summarizes 
      the current state of scientific knowledge on the effects of nicotinamide riboside 
      supplementation on sleep. Results: Pre-clinical studies indicate that NR enhances 
      the performance of the clock genes BMAL1 and PER2, and ameliorates chronic sleep 
      deprivation-induced cognitive impairment, potentially by alleviating oxidative 
      stress and mitochondrial impairment in microglia. NR supplementation also 
      increased REM sleep and reduced NREM sleep by approximately 17%. In human 
      studies, NR improved sleep efficiency in young and middle-aged male individuals 
      with insomnia. It also improved sleep quality and reduced fatigue and drowsiness 
      in older adults. More research is warranted to understand the impacts of NR on 
      sleep for women. Conclusions: NR supplementation is a reliable and effective 
      alternative to boost NAD(+) levels and may ameliorate sleep patterns.

TI  - Alginate Oligosaccharide and Gut Microbiota: Exploring the Key to Health.
LID - 1977 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17121977 [doi]
AB  - Alginate oligosaccharide (AOS), a degradation product of alginate derived from 
      marine brown algae, has attracted significant attention due to its potent ability 
      to modulate gut microbiota and enhance human health. This review aims to 
      systematically introduce current evidence on the interactions between AOS and gut 
      microbial communities, focusing on how AOS improves health through regulating gut 
      microbiota. Initially, the structural factors of AOS that influence their 
      functions are highlighted, including molecular weight, monomer composition, 
      terminal structure, and chemical modifications. Importantly, AOS primarily exerts 
      beneficial effects by adjusting gut microbiota community and outputs, which 
      include the promotion of probiotics, the inhibition of pathogens, the balance of 
      microbiota composition, and the increase of short-chain fatty acid production. 
      Moreover, the discovered mechanisms underlying AOS-mediated health promotion via 
      microbiota modulation are detailed comprehensively, specifically emphasizing 
      intestinal barrier maintenance, antioxidation, dual-regulation of immune and 
      inflammatory responses, pathogenic infection inhibition, metabolic improvement, 
      uric acid excretion promotion, anti-tumor effects, and anti-skin aging. Such 
      beneficial effects make AOS valuable in keeping healthy, preventing disorders, 
      and intervening in diseases. Despite these findings and research progress, there 
      are yet limitations in studying AOS-gut microbiota interactions, such as precise 
      microbiota-targeted structural optimization, personalized nutritional 
      interventions based on microbial characteristics, and broadening the horizon of 
      microbiota-derived metabolic metabolomic profiles. In conclusion, advancing our 
      understanding of the gut microbiota-centered mechanisms of AOS would probably 
      facilitate novel nutritional strategy development for health promotion.

TI  - Curcumin for Inflammation Control in Individuals with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus 
      and Metabolic Dysfunction-Associated Steatotic Liver Disease: A Randomized 
      Controlled Trial.
LID - 1972 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17121972 [doi]
AB  - Background: Curcumin, a bioactive polyphenol derived from turmeric, has 
      demonstrated potential therapeutic effects in metabolic dysfunction-associated 
      steatotic liver disease (MASLD) by modulating inflammation, oxidative stress, 
      hepatic fat accumulation, and fibrosis. Objective: To evaluate the efficacy of 
      curcumin in reducing hepatic steatosis and liver stiffness in patients with 
      MASLD. Methods: In this randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, 78 
      patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and MASLD were randomly assigned to 
      receive either curcumin (1500 mg/day) or placebo for 12 months. The primary 
      outcome was the change in tumor necrosis factor (TNF) levels. Secondary outcomes 
      included changes in interleukin-1 beta (IL-1beta), interleukin-6 (IL-6), antioxidant 
      enzyme activities (glutathione peroxidase, superoxide dismutase), the oxidative 
      stress marker malondialdehyde, non-esterified fatty acids, and hepatic parameters 
      (hepatic steatosis and liver stiffness). Assessments were conducted at baseline 
      and at 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Results: All participants completed the study 
      (curcumin group: n = 39; placebo group: n = 39). Curcumin significantly reduced 
      TNF levels at all follow-up points compared to placebo (p < 0.001). IL-1beta, IL-6, 
      and malondialdehyde levels also declined significantly (p < 0.001), while 
      antioxidant enzyme activities, including glutathione peroxidase and superoxide 
      dismutase, increased significantly (p < 0.001), indicating improved oxidative 
      balance. Furthermore, curcumin led to significant reductions in non-esterified 
      fatty acids, total body fat, BMI, hepatic steatosis, and liver stiffness compared 
      to placebo. Conclusions: Twelve months of curcumin supplementation improved 
      glycemic control, reduced systemic inflammation and oxidative stress, and 
      significantly improved hepatic steatosis and liver stiffness in patients with 
      MASLD. These findings support curcumin as a promising adjunctive therapy for 
      MASLD management.

TI  - Calcium Supplement Combined with Dietary Supplement Kidtal Can Promote 
      Longitudinal Growth of Long Bone in Calcium-Deficient Adolescent Rats.
LID - 1966 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17121966 [doi]
AB  - Objective: Growth retardation in adolescents caused by nutritional deficiency 
      requires effective intervention. A novel dietary supplement containing bamboo 
      shoot extract, amino acids, and calcium citrate (Kidtal + Ca, KDTCa) was 
      evaluated for its growth-promoting effects. Methods: After acclimatization, 
      sixty-three 3-week-old male Sprague-Dawley (SD) rats were randomly divided into a 
      normal control group and model groups. Growth retardation was induced in the 
      modeling groups through calcium-deficient feeding, followed by administration of 
      KDTCa, bamboo shoot extract and amino acids (Kidtal), or calcium citrate (CC). 
      After 6 weeks of intragastric administration, the mechanical properties, 
      microstructure, and growth plate development of bone were evaluated using 
      three-point bending, micro-CT, and H&E staining, respectively. Bone 
      calcium/phosphorus distribution and fecal calcium apparent absorption rate were 
      measured by ICP-MS. Results: All inter-group differences were analyzed using 
      one-way analysis of variance and checked using the Tuckey test. KDTCa treatment 
      dose-dependently enhanced bone development in calcium-deficient rats. Compared to 
      the model group, H-KDTCa significantly restored naso-anal length (p < 0.05) and 
      body weight (p < 0.01). KDTCa supplementation significantly restored calcium and 
      phosphorus levels in blood and bone. Three-point bending experiments showed that 
      the stiffness and bending energy were increased by 142.58% and 384.7%. In bone 
      microarchitecture, both bone mineral density (BMD) and microstructural parameters 
      were significantly improved. These findings were consistent with the increased 
      long bone length (p < 0.05) and decreased serum BALP/TRACP levels (p < 0.001). 
      Dose-dependent IGF-1 elevation (p < 0.01) potentially mediated growth plate 
      elongation by 35.34%. Notably, KDTCa increased calcium apparent absorption by 
      6.1% versus calcium-only supplementation at equal intake. Conclusions: KDTCa 
      improves bone microstructure and strength, restores bone metabolism, and enhances 
      growth plate height via promoting IGF-1 secretion to facilitate bone development. 
      Further studies are needed to determine whether the components and calcium in 
      Kidtal have a synergistic effect.

LID - 10.3390/nu17121964 [doi]
AB  - Cognitive aging is a complex, multifactorial process influenced by genetic, 
      metabolic, and environmental factors. Among modifiable risk factors, nutrition 
      has emerged as a promising target to preserve cognitive function. This review 
      provides a comprehensive overview of the impact of dietary 
      interventions-including specific nutrients and dietary patterns-on cognitive 
      domains (memory, executive function, global cognition) and mental health. Recent 
      findings: multinutrient supplementation, particularly combinations of B vitamins 
      and omega-3 fatty acids, appears beneficial for episodic memory, especially in 
      individuals with metabolic risk or early cognitive impairment. Antioxidant-rich 
      diets and the MIND diet are consistently associated with better memory and global 
      cognitive outcomes in observational studies. Effects on executive function and 
      mental health remain heterogeneous, although subgroups such as those with mild 
      cognitive impairment or depression may derive benefit. Evidence from 
      interventional studies remains limited by methodological variability. In 
      conclusion, dietary interventions offer a safe and promising approach to support 
      cognitive health in aging. Future research should focus on developing 
      personalized, multidomain prevention models tailored to individual risk profiles.

      kidney-gut axis. In CKD, two pathological gut conditions-disturbed gut microbiota 
      composition called uremic dysbiosis and leaky gut-contribute to the progression 
      of CKD. Dysbiosis is associated with the increased production of gut-derived 
      uremic toxins, leaky gut, and chronic systemic inflammation, leading to worsening 
      uremia, which in turn aggravates the gut condition. This vicious cycle should be 
      a target of the therapeutic strategy against CKD. The modulation of uremic 
      dysbiosis, including prebiotics, probiotics, and synbiotics, has been a typical 
      treatment approach, although clinical evidence for their efficacy has been 
      insufficient. Some non-antibiotic drugs have an impact on human gut bacteria that 
      are believed to play a role in their clinical efficacy on kidney function. 
      Nutrition therapies, including a low-protein diet, dietary fiber, a Mediterranean 
      diet, and whole grains, positively influence gut microbiota composition and have 
      been linked to a decreased risk of CKD. Novel strategies are currently being 
      explored, involving the use of postbiotics, microbiome sequencing techniques, and 
      fecal microbiota transplantation, although clinical application remains to be 
      tested. Human trials investigating the above-mentioned interventions remain 
      inconclusive due to several limitations, including dietary variability and 
      genetic factors. Future research should focus on the development of more 
      effective probiotics, prebiotics, and microbial metabolism-modifying drugs, not 
      only for CKD but for other systemic diseases as well.

      Review.

AB  - The complications observed in preterm infants are largely attributable to 
      underdeveloped organ systems and inadequate nutritional stores at birth. 
      Insufficient nutritional support can further exacerbate persistent sequelae, such 
      as bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD), metabolic bone disease of prematurity 
      (MBDP), and retinopathy of prematurity (ROP). As a result, clinicians have 
      collaborated to develop optimal nutrition strategies for preterm neonates. 
      However, these clinical nutrition plans may be hindered by several factors, 
      including fluid restrictions due to patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) and delayed 
      enteral nutrition following necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC). Modified strategies 
      for specific conditions can help prevent further deterioration, but inadequate 
      nutritional support may limit organ growth and contribute to additional 
      complications. Achieving an optimal balance between nutritional support and 
      managing specific medical conditions varies across institutions. In addition to 
      fluid balance and energy intake, supplementary nutrition-such as vitamins and 
      probiotics-plays a crucial role in disease prevention. Drawing on recent evidence 
      and our clinical experiences with neonatal nutritional strategies, this review 
      article summarizes the specialized nutritional management required for preterm 
      neonates with conditions such as BPD, NEC, MBDP, PDA, and ROP.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Ulcerative colitis is closely associated with intestinal stem cell 
      (ISC) loss and impaired intestinal mucus barrier. Sinisan (SNS), a compound 
      Chinese herbal medicine, has a long history in the treatment of intestinal 
      dysfunction, yet whether SNS can relieve acute experimental colitis by modulating 
      ISC proliferation and secretory cell differentiation has not been studied. Our 
      study tested the effect of SNS against acute colitis and focused on the 
      mechanisms involving intestinal barrier recovery. METHODS: Network pharmacology 
      analysis and blood entry component analysis of SNS were used to explore the 
      underlying mechanism by which SNS affects the acute dextran sulfate sodium 
      (DSS)-induced murine colitis model. RNA-sequencing was used to demonstrate the 
      mechanism. Further, reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, 
      immunofluorescence staining, and alcian blue and periodic acid-Schiff staining 
      were performed in vivo and in the colonic organoids to investigate the cell 
      lineage differentiation-related mechanism of SNS. Furthermore, potential active 
      ingredients from SNS were predicted by network pharmacology analysis. RESULTS: 
      SNS dramatically suppressed DSS-induced acute colonic inflammation in mice. 
      RNA-sequencing analysis revealed downregulation of inflammation and 
      apoptosis-related genes, and upregulation of lipid metabolism and 
      proliferation-related genes, such as Irf7, Pparalpha, Clspn and Hspa5. Additionally, 
      ISC renewal and intestinal secretory cell lineage commitment were significantly 
      promoted by SNS both in vivo and in vitro in colonic organoids, leading to 
      enhanced mucin expression. Furthermore, potential active ingredients from SNS 
      that mediated inflammation, lipid metabolism, proliferation, apoptosis, stem 
      cells and secretory cells were predicted using a network pharmacology approach. 
      CONCLUSION: Our study shed light on the underlying mechanism of SNS in 
      attenuating acute colitis from the perspective of ISC renewal and secretory 
      lineage cell differentiation, suggesting a of novel therapeutic strategy against 
      colitis. Please cite this article as: Cai YJ, Lan JH, Li S, Feng YN, Li FH, Guo

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the mechanism of Pingchuanning Formula (PCN) for 
      inhibiting airway inflammation in rats with asthmatic cold syndrome. METHODS: A 
      total of 105 SD rats were randomized equally into 7 groups, including a control 
      group, an asthmatic cold syndrome model group, 3 PCN treatment groups at high, 
      medium and low doses, a Guilong Kechuanning (GLCKN) treatment group, and a 
      dexamethasone (DEX) treatment group. In all but the control rats, asthma cold 
      syndrome models were established and daily gavage of saline, PCN, GLCKN or DEX 
      was administered 29 days after the start of modeling. The changes in general 
      condition, lung function and lung histopathology of the rats were observed, and 
      inflammatory factors in the alveolar lavage fluid (BALF), oxidative stress, lung 
      tissue ultrastructure, cytokine levels, and expressions of the genes related to 
      the HMGB1/Beclin-1 axis and autophagy were analyzed. RESULTS: The rat models had 
      obvious manifestations of asthmatic cold syndrome with significantly decreased 
      body mass, food intake, and water intake, reduced FEV(0.3), FVC, and 
      FEV(0.3)/FVC, obvious inflammatory cell infiltration in the lung tissue, and 
      increased alveolar inflammation score and counts of neutrophils, eosinophils, 
      lymphocytes, macrophages, and leukocytes in the BALF. The rat models also had 
      significantly increased MDA level and decreased SOD level and exhibited obvious 
      ultrastructural changes in the lung tissues, where the expressions of HMGB1, 
      Beclin-1, ATG5, TNF-alpha, IL-6,IL-1beta, and IL-13 and the LC3II/I ratio were 
      increased, while the levels of Bcl-2 and IFN-gamma were decreased. PCN treatment 
      significantly improved these pathological changes in the rat models, and its 
      therapeutic effect was better than that of GLKCN and similar to that of DEX. 
      CONCLUSIONS: PCN can effectively alleviate airway inflammation in rat models of 
      asthmatic cold syndrome possibly by modulating the HMGB1/Beclin-1 signaling axis 
      to suppress cell autophagy, thereby attenuating airway inflammatory damages.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Thin endometrium poses a major therapeutic challenge in assisted 
      reproductive technologies by compromising pregnancy success and live birth 
      outcomes. A substantial proportion of patients remain refractory to existing 
      therapies. Preliminary evidence suggests acupuncture may improve endometrial 
      thickness (EMT). This study aims to assess the effect of acupuncture against sham 
      acupuncture for women with thin endometrium. METHODS AND ANALYSIS: This study is 
      a single-centre, randomised, sham-controlled trial conducted at a specialised 
      acupuncture hospital in Beijing, China. A total of 120 women with thin 
      endometrium will be randomised (1:1) to receive 36 sessions of acupuncture or 
      sham acupuncture over 12 weeks. The primary outcome is the EMT at week 12. 
      Secondary outcomes are endometrial pattern, uterine arterial blood flow 
      parameters (Pulsatility Index, Resistance Index and the ratio of peak systolic to 
      end-diastolic blood flow velocities), endometrium blood flow, serum oestradiol 
      concentration, clinical pregnancy rate and Self-Rating Anxiety Scale Scores. 
      ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: This study has been approved by the ethics committee of 
      the Institute of Acupuncture and Moxibustion, China Academy of Chinese Medical 
      Sciences (approval no.: S2024-04-23-1). Each participant will be required to 
      provide written informed consent before enrolment. Findings will be disseminated 
      through peer-reviewed publications and conference presentations. TRIAL

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Erythrophleum teysmannii (Kurz) Craib is a 
      medicinal plant used by traditional healers in Laos and Thailand to treat cancer. 
      Despite ethnopharmacological reports about plant extracts from this genus as 
      cancer drug formulae, there is a knowledge gap about the chemical composition and 
      potential pharmacological effects of E. teysmannii. AIM OF THE STUDY: The study 
      aimed to investigate the phytochemical constituents of the leaf and twig DCM/MeOH 
      extract of E. teysmannii and their antiproliferative properties, and to support 
      its traditional uses. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bioassay-guided phytochemical 
      investigation of the organic solvent extract of the plant led to the isolation of 
      21 pure compounds. Their structures were determined by extensive spectroscopic 
      and spectrometric analyses, chemical derivatization and hydrolysis approaches, 
      and ECD computational studies. Pure compounds were assessed for their 
      antiproliferative activities against a panel of NCI-60 human tumor cell lines. 
      RESULTS: Thirteen new cassaine diterpenoid amine monomers erythroteysamines A-M 
      (1, 4-9, 11-14, 16, and 19) and two new dimers erythroteysamines N and O (20 and 
      21), together with six previously reported analogues (2, 3, 10, 15, 17, and 18) 
      were isolated. Sixteen compounds were tested in the NCI-60 assay, and they all 
      averaged low micromolar antiproliferative potency. CONCLUSION: The isolated 
      compounds from E. teysmannii showed antiproliferative activities, providing 
      chemical and pharmacological evidence supporting the traditional use of the plant 
      in herbal medicine.

AB  - An integrated platform of screening multi-compounds and evaluating bio-affinity 
      is critical to explain the molecular mechanism of complex herbal medicine on 
      various diseases. Here we developed a micro- and multi-chamber membrane 
      separation electrophoresis system (MCMSE) based on the concept of bio-affinity, 
      chamber-electrophoresis and membrane separation. It can enable simultaneous, 
      rapid and high-throughput screening of multi- potential bioactive components in 
      <15 min at low voltage (<35 V), which maintains the dynamic and original 
      structure of biomacromolecules without immobilization. Based on the bio-affinity 
      interaction and efficient separation of target protein/active components 
      complexes and free small molecules, MCMSE demonstrates the function to 
      determinate binding constants (K(b)) between proteins and active components by 
      the known interaction systems, with the potential for broad-spectrum 
      determination. MCMSE has been applied to find 7 potential bioactive compounds of 
      alpha-glucosidase (alpha-Gluc) from Scutellaria baicalensis Georgi extract, showing 
      satisfactory screening reproducibility. Among these, the moderate bio-affinity 
      interactions of three compounds with alpha-Gluc (isoschaftoside, baicalin, oroxylin 
      A-7-O-glucuronide, wogonoside) were further verified by fluorescence quenching 
      depending on the concentration of small molecules, with the K(b)(s) =10(4)  approximately  
      10(5) M(-1). The proposed bio-affinity screening and evaluation system has the 
      advantages of non-immobilization targets, fast, universality to be a potential 
      way to explore the interaction between single-target and multi bioactive 
      components and elucidate synergistic mechanism of herbal medicine.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Synovitis is a pivotal pathological hallmark of arthritis, and timely 
      intervention is essential for mitigating joint degeneration. Jiangu formula (JGF) 
      can reduce inflammation in joint synovial fluid. However, its mechanism in 
      treating synovial inflammation remains unclear. METHOD: Chemical characterization 
      of JGF's principal constituents was achieved through liquid chromatography-tandem 
      mass spectrometry analysis. This study established a CFA -induced adjuvant 
      arthritis model and investigated both the joint synovium and gut ecology. Through 
      methodologies including 16S rRNA gene sequencing, it elucidated the mechanism by 
      which JGF influences joint inflammation by modulating the NF-kappaB/NLRP3 signaling 
      pathway and regulating gut microbiota structure. RESULTS: JGF significantly 
      improved behavioral and histopathological alterations in the CFA-induced mouse, 
      enhanced locomotor function, reduced serum inflammatory factor levels, 
      downregulated NF-kappaB/NLRP3 pathway in joint and gut tissues, and modulated the 
      structure of gut microbiota. It may reduce inflammation by promoting arginine and 
      proline metabolism, inhibiting amino sugar and nucleotide sugar metabolism, 
      aiding in the repair of the intestinal mucosa. CONCLUSION: JGF ameliorates 
      synovial inflammatory response in mice model through modulation of gut microbiota 
      structure and intervention in the NF-kappaB/NLRP3 signaling pathway, with the 
      beneficial effects demonstrating gut microbiota dependency.

      ischemic stroke (IS), along with the primary active compounds and precise 
      mechanisms of action, require elucidation. METHODS: Network pharmacology analyses 
      and molecular docking were performed to integrate information related to Evodia 
      rutaecarpa and IS. Cell oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) and rat middle cerebral 
      artery occlusion (MCAO) models were established to simulate cerebral ischemic 
      injury. The effects of rutaecarpine on these models were evaluated to assess its 
      effect on IS. RESULTS: Network pharmacological analysis indicated that 
      rutaecarpine from Evodia rutaecarpa showed therapeutic effects against IS. The 
      mechanism underlying these effects mainly involved the mitogen-activated protein 
      kinase (MAPK), and targets such as matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-9, caspase 3 
      and MMP-2 may be activated to exert these effects. In vitro studies showed that 
      rutaecarpine significantly improved the mitochondrial membrane potential of HT22 
      cells, reduced the production of reactive oxygen species, and reversed 
      OGD-induced cytotoxicity. In the MCAO rat model, pretreatment with rutaecarpine 
      significantly reduced neuronal death, decreased infarct volume, and improved 
      neurological functional deficits. In addition, rutaecarpine alleviated damage to 
      the blood-brain barrier in the brain tissue. These effects may be related to the 
      regulation of the MAPK-mediated MMPs pathway. CONCLUSION: This study revealed the 
      neuroprotective effects and molecular mechanisms of rutaecarpine on IS, providing 
      a new theoretical basis for the clinical application of Evodia rutaecarpa.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Cerebral infarction (stroke) is a major global public health issue. 
      This study explores the mechanisms by which electroacupuncture affects motor 
      function after cerebral infarction by combining complementary experimental 
      approaches in middle cerebral artery occlusion mice. The work focuses 
      particularly on the Wnt/hypoxia-inducible factor-1 alpha (HIF1A)/netrin-1 
      signaling axis and downstream targets, including netrin-1 and vascular 
      endothelial growth factor (VEGF), to provide a comprehensive understanding of the 
      mechanisms that underpin electroacupuncture stimulation after stroke. METHODS: 
      The middle cerebral artery occlusion model was established with 
      electroacupuncture intervention. The cerebral cortex of mice was collected for 
      detections, including RNA sequencing, western blot, immunofluorescence, 
      quantitative PCR, and so forth. HIF1A-overexpressing and knockdown cell lines in 
      SH-SY5Y cells were used for further verification. RESULTS: Exosome and RNA 
      sequencing identified the key microRNA mir-210 and the Wnt/HIF1A/netrin-1 
      signaling axis after electroacupuncture treatment at head acupoints in the murine 
      model. In addition, the HIF1A transcription factor was upregulated and bound to 
      promoters of genes for netrin-1 and VEGF thereby activating transcription of 
      these loci. Dual luciferase reporter assays revealed that mir-210 targets the 
      gene for the tumor suppressor adenomatous polyposis coli, thereby stimulating the 
      Wnt-signaling pathway. Furthermore, behavioral experiments demonstrated that 
      electroacupuncture intervention in the Wnt/HIF1A/netrin-1 signaling axis improved 
      motor function in middle cerebral artery occlusion mice. CONCLUSION: The study 
      reveals that electroacupuncture stimulation promotes angiogenesis and neural 
      reconstruction after cerebral infarction by regulating the Wnt/HIF1A/netrin-1 
      signaling axis through mir-210, and suggests novel therapeutic targets for the 
      treatment of cerebral infarction with electroacupuncture.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Chinese patent medicine is a crucial component of traditional 
      Chinese medicine, significantly promoting public health. Despite the extensive 
      research on Chinese patent medicine for children, various issues persist in its 
      application. Leveraging the national drug coding standard code database of the 
      National Medical Products Administration (NMPA), this investigation delved into 
      the accessibility of Chinese patent medicines tailored for children, offering a 
      comprehensive overview of the current landscape in China. This analysis serves as 
      a valuable resource for formulating targeted policies to promote the use of 
      Chinese patent medicines for children, guiding drug selection, and facilitating 
      the development of pediatric pharmaceuticals. METHODS: Taking Chinese patent 
      medicines with ""National Medicine Approval Number Z"" and ""National Medicine 
      Approval Number B"" from the NMPA National Drug Coding Database as the research 
      subjects, this study systematically analyzed the distribution, characteristics, 
      and existing issues of Chinese patent medicines for children using descriptive 
      statistical methods. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION: As of May 2023, 8,903 approved 
      ""National Medicine Approval Number Z"" Chinese patent medicines, 951 approved 
      ""National Medicine Approval Number B"" Chinese patent medicines in China, with 
      1,164 Chinese patent medicines for children identified. Chinese patent medicines 
      for children are predominantly administered orally (92.87%), while external 
      preparations are limited. The taste profile is primarily bitter or sweet, with 
      some medications having other undesirable flavors. The therapeutic focus is 
      skewed toward pulmonary system diseases (31.9%) and spleen-stomach diseases 
      (26.5%). Notably, 49.66% of the medications mention Western medical disease 
      names, and 63.92% reference traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) syndrome types. 
      Critical gaps include unclear age-specific dosage instructions (56.70%), lack of 
      specified treatment duration (92.01%), and incomplete safety information, with 
      adverse reactions mainly involving the gastrointestinal system. Current issues 
      include the limited availability of Chinese patent medicines for children, poor 
      suitability for children, imbalanced research and supply (over-concentration in 
      pulmonary and spleen-stomach disorders), and inadequate safety labeling in drug 
      instructions, posing potential risks. Recommendations include developing new 
      Chinese patent medicines for children, improving drug suitability, conducting 
      post-marketing evaluations, and refining drug labeling to ensure safe and 
      rational pediatric medication use.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the clear clinical efficacy of the herbal formula Suhuang 
      in treating cough variant asthma (CVA), its underlying mechanisms of action 
      (MOAs) remain poorly understood. Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) offers a 
      unique framework for disease treatment based on traditional herbal theories. 
      However, the molecular basis of these theories remains largely unexplored. 
      METHODS: To address this gap, we proposed a novel computational paradigm to 
      understand how herbal medicines exert therapeutic effects on CVA under the 
      guidance of TCM theories. Our approach integrates transcriptional perturbation 
      data, graph neural network (GNN) models, and network proximity analysis, enabling 
      the interpretation of herbal actions within a network pharmacology context. 
      RESULTS: We found that traditional herbal theories show strong molecular-level 
      associations with therapeutic mechanisms: 1) Meridian classifications of herbs 
      align with their gene perturbation profiles across different organs; 2) Herbal 
      combinations and their therapeutic efficacy correlate with the network proximity 
      of their targets to disease-specific genes. Notably, network proximity analysis 
      revealed mechanistic support for key TCM concepts such as the JUN-CHEN-ZUO-SHI 
      hierarchy and the Lung-Large Intestine Theory; 3) By incorporating features 
      derived from traditional herbal theory, we developed two GNN-based models to 
      predict herb-disease associations and herb-herb combinations, which identified 
      potential active ingredients and synergistic formulations for CVA. DISCUSSION: 
      This study presents a novel framework for interpreting the molecular basis of 
      herbal medicines and their combinations under TCM theory guidance.

AB  - Diabetic wound healing remains a critical clinical challenge due to persistent 
      bacterial infections, oxidative stress, and chronic inflammation. Inspired by the 
      principles of traditional Chinese medicine, we developed a multifunctional 
      hydrogel (CPGel) via solvent-driven self-assembly of bioactive Chlorella 
      extracts, gelatin, and polyethylene glycol (PEG). The CPGel synergizes the 3R 
      strategy: (1) Remove-complete eradication of E. coli and S. aureus via intrinsic 
      antibacterial activity; (2) Remodel-65 % ROS scavenging and immunomodulation by 
      polarizing macrophages from proinflammatory M1 to anti-inflammatory M2 phenotypes 
      to resolve chronic inflammation; and (3) Repair-accelerated tissue regeneration 
      via 9-fold angiogenesis (alpha-SMA) and 2-fold collagen I deposition. Mechanically 
      robust (compressive strength: 4.16 MPa; tensile strength: 627 kPa) and 
      antifreezing (-100  degrees C), CPGel demonstrated exceptional transparency and adhesion, 
      ensuring seamless integration with wound sites. In diabetic mice, CPGel achieved 
      100 % wound closure within 21 days, surpassing controls (73 %), while promoting 
      neovascularization and hair follicle regeneration. This study bridges traditional 
      herbal medicine with advanced biomaterial engineering, offering a scalable, 
      toxin-free platform that addresses the triad of diabetic wound pathogenesis. By 
      harmonizing the 3R strategy-Remove, Remodel, and Repair-CPGel represents a 
      paradigm shift in chronic wound management, with high potential for clinical 
      translation and sustainable therapeutic design.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Research has explored the individual effects of phytochemicals in 
      dentistry. Our aim was to investigate the synergistic effect these compounds have 
      on pulpal pain, gingival bleeding, and oral microbial populations. METHODS: A 
      proprietary formulation consisting of tannic acid, caryophyllene, curcumin, 
      berberine, myrcene, lignin, catechin, quercetin, gallic acid, thymol, 
      gamma-terpinene, humulene, limonene, and thymoquinone was selected for testing. 
      The antimicrobial effect of the solution was tested using the disc diffusion 
      method on plaque samples cultured on tryptic soy and blood agar. The hemostatic 
      effect of the solution was evaluated by applying it to bleeding gingival tissues 
      during the scaling procedure and recording the time until the cessation of 
      free-flowing blood. The analgesic effect was measured through the Visual Analogue 
      Scale (VAS) before and after topical application of the solution to the affected 
      tooth. Time until self-reported reduction in pain was also noted. RESULTS: The 
      mean zone of inhibition of the solution on tryptic soy agar and blood agar was 20 
      mm and 13 mm, compared to 17 mm and 15 mm of azithromycin. Colonies of Candida, 
      Streptococci, and Staphylococci were identified and confirmed from the culture, 
      showing susceptibility to the solution. The mean time until complete hemostasis 
      was 5.8 +/- 0.74 seconds. The mean pain score before application of the solution 
      was 68 +/- 11.4, and after application was 22+/-12.6, with a P-value of <0.01. The 
      mean time for self-reported pain reduction by patients was 38 seconds. 
      CONCLUSION: The promising results from this pilot study suggest significant 
      therapeutic efficacy, and future in-depth investigations are recommended to fully 
      explore the potential of this novel herbal dental formulation.

      report.
PG  - 103618
LID - 10.12998/wjcc.v13.i18.103618 [doi]

AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) comprises a group of chronic 
      inflammatory gastrointestinal disorders, including Crohn's disease (CD) and 
      ulcerative colitis, with uncertain etiologies. The natural course of IBD can be 
      accompanied by extraintestinal manifestations involving the skin, mucous 
      membranes, musculoskeletal structures, eyes, cardiovascular system and nervous 
      system. Guillain-Barre syndrome (GBS) is a type of peripheral neuropathy. 
      However, the etiology and pathogenesis of IBD combined with GBS are unclear, and 
      only a few clinical cases have been reported. Here, we report a case of 
      refractory CD complicated by GBS and review the previous literature to improve 
      the understanding of these diseases. CASE SUMMARY: A 34-year-old man had a 9-year 
      history of refractory CD. He became unresponsive to multiple drugs and 
      experienced recurrent intestinal fistulas. After several abdominal surgeries and 
      treatment with ustekinumab, he achieved clinical remission. Unfortunately, he 
      developed GBS during maintenance treatment with ustekinumab. According to 
      previous reports, in some patients with IBD combined with GBS, GBS may be a 
      comorbidity, an extraintestinal manifestation of IBD, or an adverse reaction to 
      IBD therapeutic drugs. After a comprehensive evaluation, we suspected that GBS 
      might have been a comorbidity in this patient. To avoid fatal disease relapse 
      after medication discontinuation, we concluded that ustekinumab should not be 
      withdrawn. On the basis of a joint decision between doctors and the patient, we 
      decided to continue maintenance treatment with ustekinumab along with intravenous 
      immunoglobulin, dexamethasone and traditional Chinese medicine acupuncture, which 
      resulted in a steady improvement in his GBS symptoms and sustained remission of 
      CD. CONCLUSION: When IBD is complicated by a neurological disease, it is first 
      necessary to analyze the patient's condition and then choose the corresponding 
      treatment strategy. If the neurological disease is a specific comorbidity, 
      treatment of both IBD and the comorbid disease should be considered. For IBD 
      patients with extraintestinal manifestations involving the nervous system, 
      neurological manifestations tend to resolve when the active IBD is controlled. 
      When an adverse drug reaction is suspected, the medication should be 
      discontinued, and symptomatic treatment should be administered.

LID - 10.4103/nah.nah_187_24 [doi]
AB  - With the rapid development of industrialisation, noise exposure is becoming 
      increasingly prevalent. The detrimental effects of noise-induced hearing loss 
      (NIHL) have become clinically relevant. Therefore, effective drug therapeutic 
      strategies for NIHL are urgently needed. This article reviewed the 
      pathophysiology and potential molecular mechanisms of NIHL and classified and 
      summarised the drug therapeutic strategies. Drug therapeutic strategies of NIHL 
      can be further studied in agents such as corticosteroids, antioxidants, 
      neurotrophic factors, herbal medicine, magnesium and statins. Given the current 
      research progress, ongoing positive test results and pilot studies may lead to 
      new pharmacological regimens to alleviate NIHL.

AB  - Traditional oncological therapies have contributed to reducing the global cancer 
      burden; however, they have not achieved complete eradication, nor have they 
      effectively prevented relapses, minimized toxicity, or preserved immune function. 
      Recent advances, particularly the introduction of immune checkpoint inhibitors 
      (ICIs) and CAR-T cell therapies, have markedly improved clinical outcomes and 
      overall survival in certain cancer subtypes. Nevertheless, response rates remain 
      suboptimal, and adverse immunological events are frequent. This review starts by 
      highlighting the FDA-approved ICIs currently utilized in cancer immunotherapy, 
      emphasizing those that have demonstrated clinical efficacy in recent years. The 
      true focus of our analysis is on the latest clinical applications of 
      near-infrared photoimmunotherapy (NIR-PIT). This emerging modality is evaluated 
      in patients with head and neck cancers (HNC), particularly in cases that are 
      unresectable, locally advanced, or recurrent. Finally, the review explores the 
      current landscape and prospects of NIR-PIT, considering its potential to enhance 
      therapeutic efficacy and extend relapse-free survival. Photoimmunotherapy is a 
      promising, molecularly targeted option for patients with limited prognosis, 
      offering new hope where conventional therapies fail. By synthesizing recent 
      clinical trial data, this work highlights how NIR-PIT could bridge the 
      translational gap between preclinical research and clinical practice. The 
      integration of advanced technologies and interdisciplinary collaboration among 
      researchers, clinicians, and technologists will be critical in optimizing 
      NIR-PIT, improving its accuracy, efficacy, and safety, and ultimately advancing 
      standards of cancer care and patient survival.

TI  - Exploring Antioxidant, Antimicrobial and Anti-Inflammatory Effects of Juglans 
      regia and Pfaffia paniculata Extracts: Implications for Intestinal Dysbiosis and 
      Colorectal Cancer Risk Associated with Oral Pathogens.
LID - 693 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics17060693 [doi]
AB  - Background/Objectives: Colorectal neoplasms rank as the third most prevalent 
      cancer globally and stand as the second leading cause of cancer-related 
      mortality. Its etiology is multifaceted, pointing to the role of microorganisms 
      within the human microbiota in its development. Notably, the high prevalence of 
      oral pathogens like Fusobacterium nucleatum and Parvimonas micra is implicated in 
      inducing gut dysbiosis and stimulating the proliferation and metastasis of cancer 
      cells. Therefore, this study aimed to evaluate in vitro the biological effects of 
      extracts from Juglans regia and Pfaffia paniculata. Methods: Phytochemical 
      analysis was carried out by HPLC, and the antioxidant effect was determined by 
      DPPH. Antimicrobial activity was investigated on F. nucleatum and P. micra 
      planktonic and biofilms. Metabolic activity and genotoxicity were performed. 
      Results:J. regia and P. paniculata expressed CE50 37.26 and 1367.57 mcg, 
      respectively. The extracts exhibited a minimum bactericidal concentration of 1.73 
      and 0.48 mg/mL for J. regia and P. paniculata, respectively. Reduction superiorly 
      90% of P. micra biofilms. Metabolic activity was varied proportionally to the 
      extract concentration, and no genotoxic effects were observed. Conclusions: The 
      J. regia extract has great antioxidant activity and could be used as an 
      alternative in combating pathogens associated with the onset of dysbiosis and 
      tumor progression in colorectal neoplasms. Nevertheless, further studies are 
      needed to validate their clinical applicability.

TI  - Effects of Periploca chevalieri Browicz on Postprandial Glycemia and 
      Carbohydrate-Hydrolyzing Enzymes.
LID - 913 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph18060913 [doi]
AB  - Background/Objectives:Periploca chevalieri Browicz (Apocynaceae), an endemic 
      species of the Cabo Verde archipelago, is commonly used in traditional medicine 
      for the treatment of diabetes. The aim of this study was to characterize the 
      chemical profiles of the aqueous and hydroethanolic (70%) extracts of the P. 
      chevalieri dried aerial parts (PcAE and PcEE) and evaluate their potential to 
      modulate postprandial glycemia and inhibit key carbohydrate-hydrolyzing enzymes. 
      Methods: The chemical characterization was performed by LC/UV-DAD-ESI/MS/MS. An 
      in vivo evaluation of postprandial glycemia modulation was conducted on healthy 
      CD1 mice submitted to an oral sucrose tolerance test. In vitro enzymatic 
      inhibition was performed for the alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and DPP4 enzymes. 
      Additionally, antioxidant and antiglycation activities were also assessed. 
      Results: Phenolic acid derivatives, flavanols, proanthocyanidins, and flavonols 
      were the major classes of secondary metabolites identified. PcEE at 170 mg/kg of 
      body weight significantly (p < 0.05) reduced the postprandial glycemia peak in 
      CD1 mice submitted to sucrose overload. Regarding the enzymatic inhibition, both 
      extracts showed concentration-dependent inhibitory potential against the 
      alpha-amylase, alpha-glucosidase, and DPP4 enzymes. Both extracts inhibited alpha-glucosidase 
      more effectively than acarbose. Conclusions: The obtained results supports the 
      traditional use of P. chevalieri and suggest the potential for further 
      pharmacological investigation.

TI  - Validation of a Traditional Medicine, Achyrocline satureioides Infusion, for the 
      Improvement of Mild Respiratory Infection Symptoms: A Randomized, 
      Placebo-Controlled and Open-Label Clinical Trial.
LID - 861 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph18060861 [doi]
AB  - Background/Objectives: The need for the scientific validation of traditional and 
      folk medicine knowledge has emerged lately. Achyrocline satureioides 
      inflorescences have been widely used for the management of mild viral respiratory 
      infection symptoms in South Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina. We intended to assess 
      the therapeutic efficacy of a 14-day course with A. satureioides for mild viral 
      respiratory infection symptoms. Methods: We conducted a randomized, open-label, 
      placebo-controlled trial. Before COVID-19 (SARS-CoV-2) diagnostic tests, 
      participants were randomly assigned to one of two experimental groups: A. 
      satureioides or Malus domestica infusions, with instructions to use the infusions 
      twice a day for 14 days. Our primary endpoint was the recovery time for 
      respiratory symptoms in the overall analysis; the secondary outcomes were the 
      recovery time for non-respiratory symptoms and for stratified analysis, taking 
      into account the vaccination status against SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19 infection; 
      and the rate of symptom recovery was also evaluated. Results: The A. satureioides 
      infusion significantly accelerated the resolution of sore throat and sneezing 
      compared with the control group. The participants with COVID-19 who had not been 
      vaccinated and received A. satureioides infusion recovered faster from sore 
      throat, body ache, fever and cough, and showed a shorter median survival time for 
      symptom resolution. The SARS-CoV-2-negative group that received A. satureioides 
      had a faster improvement in the survival analysis of sore throat, earache and 
      loss of appetite. Conclusions: Our findings support the hypothesis that 
      Achyrocline satureioides inflorescence infusions may offer therapeutic benefits 
      in the management of mild viral respiratory infections, as its administration was 
      associated with a significantly accelerated resolution of clinical symptoms. This 
      study was registered in the Brazilian Registry of Clinical Trials (ReBEC; 
      registration number RBR-8g6f2rv) on 27 January 2022.

TI  - The Efficacy and Safety Herbal Medicine for Symptom Management After HIFU 
      Treatment in Adenomyosis: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - 843 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph18060843 [doi]
AB  - Background/Objectives: Adenomyosis (AM) is a hormone-dependent gynecological 
      disorder that negatively impacts the quality of life and fertility of 
      reproductive-age women. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of herbal 
      medicine (HM) as a post-treatment strategy following high-intensity focused 
      ultrasound (HIFU) therapy. Methods: English, Chinese, and Korean databases were 
      systematically searched up to 24 March 2025. Eligible randomized controlled 
      trials (RCTs) compared HM administration after HIFU therapy with HIFU therapy 
      alone. Statistical analyses included mean difference (MD), standardized mean 
      difference (SMD), and risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs). 
      Evidence quality was assessed using GRADE approach. The protocol was registered 
      with INPLASY (No.: INPLASY202530088). Results: Fourteen RCTs involving 1259 
      patients were included in the review. HM administration after HIFU therapy showed 
      superior efficacy over HIFU therapy alone in reducing uterine volume (MD = 
      -11.84, 95% CI: -13.74 to -9.95; p < 0.00001), adenomyotic lesion volume (MD = 
      -2.86, 95% CI: -3.29 to -2.43; p < 0.00001), serum CA125 levels (SMD = -1.49, 95% 
      CI: -2.41 to -0.58; p < 0.00001), serum estradiol (E2) levels (SMD = -1.28, 95% 
      CI: -1.54 to -1.03; p < 0.0001), and improvements in dysmenorrhea (MD = -0.54, 
      95% CI: -1.06 to -0.02; p < 0.00001) Conclusions: HM may be an effective and safe 
      adjunct to HIFU for managing AM. However, further high-quality RCTs with 
      long-term follow-up are needed to validate these findings.

TI  - Arecoline Triggers Psychostimulant Responses by Modulating the Intestinal 
      Microbiota to Influence Neurotransmitter Levels and Digestive Enzyme Activity.
LID - 794 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/ph18060794 [doi]
AB  - Background:Areca catechu L. is an evergreen tree belonging to the Arecaceae 
      family. As an important traditional Chinese medicine, it has wide applications in 
      the field of herbal medicine. Arecoline is the main active component responsible 
      for its medicinal effects and plays a key role in its central nervous system 
      (CNS) stimulant properties. Methods: This study investigated the excitatory 
      effects of arecoline by analyzing behavioral changes in mice, neurotransmitter 
      levels, the intestinal microbiota composition, and enzymatic activities. We 
      further explored the bidirectional interactions between the intestinal microbial 
      ecosystem and the nervous system following arecoline exposure. Results: Arecoline 
      administration significantly increased the activity time ratio in mice (p < 
      0.05). It also elevated fecal lactase and amylase activities (p < 0.05), 
      suggesting enhanced carbohydrate metabolism that may be one of the reasons for 
      the increased activity time of mice. Serum analysis showed decreased 
      5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT, p < 0.05), increased dopamine (DA) and brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) levels (p < 0.001), and no significant change in 
      gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA). These findings suggest that arecoline may also play a 
      role in modulating neurotransmitter balance. At the genus level, Escherichia was 
      significantly enriched and positively correlated with DA, BDNF, and GABA, while 
      Clostridium abundance decreased and was positively correlated with 5-HT. 
      Conclusions: Arecoline administration altered multiple enzymatic activities and 
      the microbial composition abundance in the mouse intestine, eliciting 
      psychostimulant effects while maintaining neurotransmitter homeostasis. This 
      study provides an experimental foundation for further pharmacological 
      exploitation of arecoline.

TI  - Effectiveness and Safety of Pharmacopuncture Therapy Compared to Standard 
      Physical Therapy in Patients with Chronic Knee Pain: A Pilot Study for a 
      Pragmatic Randomized Controlled Trial.
LID - 10.3390/medicina61061106 [doi]
LID - 1106
AB  - Background and Objectives: There have been a limited number of randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) comparing pharmacopuncture therapy (PPT) and physical 
      therapy (PT) for chronic knee pain. In this study, we assess the feasibility, 
      safety, and preliminary effectiveness of PPT compared to PT in patients with 
      chronic knee pain. Materials and Methods: This pilot study was designed as a 
      two-arm, parallel RCT. Patients were recruited through in-hospital 
      advertisements. Forty patients aged 19 to 70 with knee pain with a numeric rating 
      scale (NRS) score of 5, persisting for >3 months, were randomized into the PPT or 
      PT group. The type of PT solution or PT method was not determined in advance, 
      leaving it to the clinician's judgment. Treatment was administered twice weekly 
      for 3 weeks with a 6-week follow-up. The primary outcome was the NRS score for 
      knee pain, whereas the secondary outcomes were the visual analog scale (VAS), 
      knee range of motion, Korean Western Ontario and McMaster (K-WOMAC), Patient 
      Global Impression of Change, and five-level EuroQol five-dimension scores. 
      Additionally, adherence, acceptability, dropout rate, and adverse events were 
      measured to assess the feasibility of a follow-up main study. The protocol was 
      registered at ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT06505681). Results: The PPT group showed 
      significantly superior improvement compared with the PT group in the NRS 
      (difference = -2.05, 95% confidence interval [CI]: -2.76 to -1.34), VAS 
      (difference = -21.58, 95% CI: -29.42 to -13.74), and K-WOMAC scores (difference = 
      -13.17, 95% CI: -21.67 to -4.67). Of the 55 patients who initially expressed 
      interest in participation, 8 declined after receiving detailed information about 
      this study. Among the forty enrolled participants, one patient in the PPT group 
      dropped out, and one missed a single treatment session. Apart from these cases, 
      all participants completed the assigned treatments and follow-up assessments, 
      demonstrating high adherence. No serious adverse events were reported. 
      Conclusions: PPT demonstrated excellent effectiveness in pain relief and 
      functional improvement in these patients.

TI  - Standardized Definition of Red Flags in Musculoskeletal Care: A Comprehensive 
      Review of Clinical Practice Guidelines.
LID - 10.3390/medicina61061002 [doi]
LID - 1002
AB  - Background and Objectives: The aging population and the COVID-19 pandemic have 
      led to a rise in severe conditions, including musculoskeletal (MSK) disorders. 
      Although MSK conditions are often managed in primary care, they may sometimes 
      mask serious illnesses requiring urgent diagnosis. The red flag (RF) concept is 
      essential for identifying signs and symptoms of potentially severe disease. 
      However, RF criteria vary across clinical guidelines and lack consistency. With 
      the growing role of direct access to physiotherapy-bypassing physician 
      referral-physiotherapists must develop strong differential diagnostic skills to 
      identify serious pathologies that mimic MSK disorders. This review aims to 
      systematically map how RFs are defined in MSK clinical practice guidelines 
      (CPGs), supporting the move toward a standardized definition for clinical and 
      research use. Materials and Methods: A comprehensive literature search was 
      conducted in PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Cochrane databases. Included 
      studies were CPGs and systematic reviews (SRs) of CPGs addressing MSK disorders 
      and incorporating the RF concept. Data extraction followed a rigorous process, 
      and RF definitions were synthesized and compared in table format. Results: Out of 
      thirteen-thousand three-hundred and ninety-three articles identified, fourteen 
      met inclusion criteria (seven CPGs and seven SRs of CPGs), spanning both 
      physiotherapy and medical fields. All definitions described RFs as signs or 
      symptoms indicating possible serious pathology requiring further investigation or 
      referral. Some definitions referred broadly to ""patterns of signs or symptoms"", 
      while others offered more precise criteria. Conclusions: This review highlights 
      the lack of a standardized RF definition in MSK care, leading to inconsistencies 
      in clinical decision-making and diagnosis. To improve patient safety and guide 
      clinicians-especially in direct-access contexts-a unified, internationally 
      recognized definition of RFs is needed in future guidelines.

TI  - Kampo medicine in the management of menopausal symptoms: A narrative review of 
      therapeutic potential.
LID - 10.5582/ddt.2025.01039 [doi]
AB  - Menopausal symptoms primarily result from ovarian dysfunction and declining 
      estrogen levels, leading to multisystem disorders. Although hormone therapy 
      remains the most effective treatment, its long-term use is associated with 
      significant risks, prompting interest in alternative options. Kampo medicine, a 
      traditional Japanese system derived from Chinese herbal medicine, has gained 
      renewed attention as a complementary and personalized therapeutic approach to 
      menopausal health. This review aims to systematically summarize the current 
      application and clinical evidence of Kampo medicine in the management of 
      menopausal symptoms across multiple domains, including vasomotor, 
      neuropsychiatric, musculoskeletal, skeletal, and genitourinary systems. 
      Furthermore, the review seeks to further validate its efficacy through the 
      mechanistic actions of its key ingredients. While the therapeutic effects of 
      Kampo medicine on hot flashes have been inconsistent, it has demonstrated 
      significant efficacy in improving emotional disturbances, sleep disorders, and 
      somatic symptoms, particularly among individuals whose conditions are not driven 
      solely by hormonal imbalances. In the management of osteoporosis, the integration 
      of Kampo medicine with conventional Western treatments not only enhances overall 
      therapeutic outcomes but also contributes to the reduction of adverse effects. 
      One limitation of current research is the lack of randomized controlled trials 
      (RCTs) evaluating the efficacy of Kampo medicine in managing Genitourinary 
      Syndrome of Menopause (GSM), highlighting the need for further investigation in 
      this area. The integration of Kampo medicine into menopausal symptom management 
      may contribute to a more holistic, patient-centered approach that offers both 
      traditional and Western medical options. This integrative model has the potential 
      to support shared decision-making and improve personalized care for menopausal 
      women.

AB  - Acupuncture is an ancient treatment method used in traditional Chinese medicine 
      and has been popularized worldwide. Over the past decade, there has been an 
      increase in the amount of acupuncture research, mostly comprised of randomized 
      controlled trials (RCTs) that aimed to answer the question on the efficacy of 
      acupuncture. However, poor methodology and low replicability in these acupuncture 
      RCTs have resulted in uncertainty about the efficacy of acupuncture. In this 
      review, current advancements and challenges in acupuncture RCTs, regarding the 
      methodological aspects of randomization, blinding, sham acupuncture and quality 
      of reporting, were discussed. While there have been advancements in various 
      aspects, current acupuncture RCTs still face pressing issues such as inadequate 
      randomization and blinding, unviable sham acupuncture controls, and poor 
      reporting quality. Given these limitations, this review seeks to identify the 
      methodological problems that are responsible for these problems and to suggest 
      solutions that could help to overcome them so as to improve the quality of future 
      studies evaluating the efficacy of acupuncture. Please cite this article as:

PG  - 2523381
LID - 10.1080/15502783.2025.2523381 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Over the last two decades, bioelectrical impedance 
      analysis (BIA) has gained popularity as a method for assessing body compartments 
      in nutrition studies, sports medicine, and evaluating hydration levels, fat mass, 
      and fat-free mass variations in both healthy and diseased individuals. This study 
      aims to offer researchers an overview of the research trends in BIA. METHODS: The 
      data was obtained from the Web of Science Core Collection database. Bibliometric 
      analysis was conducted using a package of R software (Bibliometrix 4.0). RESULTS: 
      A total of 9471 articles have been published over the past 20 years, with an 
      average annual growth rate of 10.1%. The research field primarily focuses on 
      nutrition and dietetics, followed urology and nephrology, endocrinology and 
      metabolism, general and internal medicine, engineering, geriatrics and 
      gerontology, sport sciences, cardiovascular system and cardiology, physiology and 
      science and technology-other topics. The research hotspots of BIA over the past 
      20 years have transitioned from ""water"" to ""fat,"" and subsequently to 
      ""sarcopenia."" ""Sarcopenia"" and ""phase angle"" (PhA) have emerged as recent 
      research hotspots in the field of BIA. CONCLUSION: A total of 9471 articles have 
      been published over the past 20 years, with an average annual growth rate of 
      10.1%. Nutrition and dietetics have consistently been the primary research areas 
      in the field of BIA. ""Sarcopenia"" and ""PhA"" have emerged as recent research 
      hotspots in the field of BIA. The application of BIA in clinical practice still 
      holds significant untapped potential.

TI  - A case of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis with suspected 
      Saikokaryukotsuboreito involvement responding to glucocorticoid therapy.
LID - 10.1007/s13730-025-01012-2 [doi]
AB  - Drug-induced kidney injury is a major cause of acute tubulointerstitial nephritis 
      (AIN). The standard treatment for AIN is discontinuation of the causative agent; 
      however, if discontinuation alone is insufficient, glucocorticoid therapy may be 
      effective. A 51-year-old woman was admitted to our hospital with acute kidney 
      injury, presenting with an estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) of 
      6.3 mL/min/1.73m(2). She was diagnosed with AIN after a renal biopsy. 
      Drug-induced lymphocyte stimulation tests were performed on the herbal medicine 
      she had been taking for 5 months, Saikokaryukotsuboreito (comprising Bupleurum 
      root, Pinellia tuber, Scutellaria root, and Ginseng as key ingredients). The test 
      results were positive for all four components. The patient discontinued the 
      causative agent, and her renal function improved with oral glucocorticoid therapy 
      (prednisolone 30 mg/day). After 6 months of treatment, her renal function 
      stabilized, with only minor residual tubular acidosis. This case of AIN induced 
      by Saikokaryukotsuboreito, which responded to glucocorticoid therapy, highlights 
      the potential for recovery with appropriate treatment.

AB  - PURPOSE: This meta-analysis aimed to ascertain the effectiveness of acupuncture 
      in treating clinical symptoms of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and to summarize 
      the acupoints and meridians involved. METHODS: PubMed, Web of Science, Cochrane 
      Library, Embase, China National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI), and Wanfang were 
      thoroughly retrieved to acquire randomized controlled trials (RCTs) evaluating 
      acupuncture as an adjunct treatment for T2DM. Outcome measures focused on 
      improvements in T2DM clinical symptoms. The meta-analysis was implemented 
      leveraging RevMan 5.4 and Stata 15 software, with sensitivity and subgroup 
      analyses to assess the stability of results and identify heterogeneity sources. 
      RESULTS: 21 RCTs encompassing 2,117 individuals with T2DM were analyzed. The 
      results of 2-hour postprandial glucose (2h PG), body mass index (BMI), fasting 
      blood glucose (FBG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), low-density lipoprotein 
      (LDL), bilateral median nerve motor conduction velocity, and plasma viscosity 
      were reliable. No publication bias was noted, except for Packed Cell Volume (PCV) 
      and Traditional Chinese Medicine Syndrome Score Scale (TCMSS). The meta-analysis 
      showed that acupuncture significantly improved clinical markers such as glycated 
      hemoglobin A1c (HbA1c), 2h PG, FBG, and fasting serum insulin (FINS). Subgroup 
      analysis for FBG, 2h PG, and triglycerides (TG) indicated that the primary source 
      of heterogeneity for FBG was related to participants with uncomplicated T2DM and 
      a treatment duration of less than three months. No significant heterogeneity was 
      observed for 2h PG, while the TG data were unstable. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture can 
      significantly alleviate the main clinical symptoms of T2DM, but significant 
      heterogeneity was observed for individual indicators. Further investigation is 
      needed to corroborate its precise therapeutic effectiveness and identify 
      potential influencing factors. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW REGISTRATION:

TI  - The influence of post-processing methods and frequency bands on rs-fMRI: An 
      example of electroacupuncture at Zusanli (ST36).
PG  - 100238

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Electroacupuncture at Zusanli (ST36) exerted an effect on brain 
      function by regulating spontaneous brain activity. This study aims to investigate 
      the influence of different post-processing methods of amplitude of low-frequency 
      fluctuation (ALFF) and different frequency band to measure brain low-frequency 
      oscillations (LFOs) after electroacupuncture at ST36. METHODS: Twenty-eight 
      healthy subjects were recruited and received true electroacupuncture (EA) and 
      sham electroacupuncture (SA) at ST36 respectively. The rs-fMRI scans were 
      performed before and immediately after electroacupuncture. Three post-processing 
      methods were used to evaluate the amplitude of LFOs: fractional ALFF (fALFF), 
      percent amplitude of fluctuation (PerAF) and wavelet-transform ALFF 
      (Wavelet-ALFF). Besides the conventional low-frequency band (0.01-0.1Hz), three 
      additional sub-bands were observed, including slow-6 (0-0.01Hz), slow-5 
      (0.01-0.027Hz) and slow-4 (0.027-0.073Hz). Paired t-test was conducted to 
      investigate the intra-group differences of three post-processing methods before 
      and after each intervention. In the comparison of inter-group difference, the 
      paired t-test was conducted between SA and EA. RESULTS: Electroacupuncture at 
      ST36 increased LFO amplitudes, with more pronounced effects compared to SA. As 
      compared to SA, the fALFF values in the left superior frontal gyrus and orbital 
      middle frontal gyrus increased after EA. Only the EA group showed an increase in 
      Wavelet-ALFF. PerAF was the most sensitive method for detecting LFO amplitude 
      changes and revealed changes in white matter. Additionally, brain LFO changes 
      were frequency-dependent, with more favorable results observed in the 
      conventional low-frequency band and the slow-5 band. CONCLUSION: Post-processing 
      methods affect the interpretation of brain effects caused by electroacupuncture 
      at ST36. FALFF was suitable for observing brain LFO differences between EA and 
      SA. Wavelet-ALFF was stable but less sensitive. PerAF was a promising method for 
      investigating LFOs in white matter. The brain LFO changes caused by 
      electroacupuncture at ST36 were frequency-dependent.

TI  - The efficacy and safety of kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists in patients with 
      uraemic pruritus: a systematic review and network meta-analysis.
PG  - sfaf131
LID - 10.1093/ckj/sfaf131 [doi]
LID - sfaf131
AB  - BACKGROUND: Uraemic pruritus (UP) is an increasingly significant health burden. 
      However, current treatments are often unsatisfactory and associated with numerous 
      adverse reactions. Recently, several large randomized controlled trials (RCTs) 
      have confirmed that kappa opioid receptor (KOR) agonists, which target the 
      endogenous opioid system, are effective in controlling symptoms. We compared the 
      efficacy and safety of currently available KOR agonists for the treatment of UP. 
      METHODS: We conducted a systematic review and network meta-analysis (NMA) of RCTs 
      to assess the efficacy and safety of KOR agonists in patients with UP. The 
      primary outcomes were pruritus-related scales and adverse events. Two independent 
      reviewers evaluated RCTs for eligibility and extracted relevant data, with 
      discrepancies resolved by consensus or a third reviewer. We utilized a fixed 
      effects model within a Bayesian framework for the NMA. Dichotomous variables were 
      presented as risk ratios (RRs) and continuous variables were merged using 
      standardized mean differences. Statistical analyses were performed using R 4.2.3 
      and JAGS 4.3.0. The risk of bias was assessed using the RoB 2 tool and the 
      certainty of findings was rated according to Grading of Recommendations 
      Assessment, Development and Evaluation criteria. The study protocol was 
      registered on PROSPERO (CRD42020169955). RESULTS: Ten studies with 2483 
      participants were included. Concerning the primary endpoints, difelikefalin at 
      doses of 0.25 microg/kg, 0.5 microg/kg, 1.0 microg/kg and 1.5 microg/kg, nalfurafine at 2.5 microg 
      and 5 microg and nalbuphine at 120 mg were significantly effective in reducing 
      itching severity compared with placebo. For the secondary endpoint, all four 
      doses of difelikefalin were associated with higher rates of adverse events 
      compared with placebo, while other interventions showed rates comparable to those 
      of placebo and did not present statistically significant differences. CONCLUSION: 
      In summary, difelikefalin at doses of 0.25 microg/kg and 0.5 microg/kg, along with 
      nalfurafine at 0.25 microg/kg and 0.5 microg/kg, can be considered recommended 
      therapeutic options for UP treatment.

      Traditional Chinese Medicine for Osteoarthritis Knee: A Meta-Analysis.
PG  - 3087-3099
LID - 10.2147/JPR.S502457 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Given the prevalence of osteoarthritis and the growing interest in 
      alternative treatments, there is a need to provide a comprehensive evaluation of 
      this integrated TCM approach. Reviews are required to understand the potential 
      benefits and safety of the combination therapy compared to conventional 
      treatments. Hence, this meta-analysis investigates the effectiveness of combining 
      Thunder Fire Moxibustion with other Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) 
      modalities, specifically acupuncture and herbal formulas, in treating knee 
      osteoarthritis. METHODS: A comprehensive literature search across databases like 
      PubMed Central, EMBASE, MEDLINE, and others was conducted. The inclusion criteria 
      focused on randomized controlled trials involving patients with knee 
      osteoarthritis, comparing the effectiveness of Thunder Fire Moxibustion combined 
      with other TCM modalities against standard care. The Cochrane Risk of Bias tool 
      was used for bias assessment, and a random-effects inverse-variance model for 
      meta-analysis. RESULTS: Out of 1467 records, 7 studies met the inclusion 
      criteria. The pooled Risk Ratio (RR) for total effective rate was 1.119, 
      indicating a significant effect of the combined TCM treatment. Subgroup analysis 
      showed a pooled RR of 1.130 for acupuncture combinations and 1.103 for herbal TCM 
      combinations. The incidence of adverse reactions had a non-significant pooled RR 
      of 0.572. The GRADE assessment indicated a low overall quality of evidence due to 
      risks of bias and publication bias. CONCLUSION: The combination of Thunder Fire 
      Moxibustion with other TCM modalities shows potential effectiveness in treating 
      knee osteoarthritis, with minimal adverse reactions. However, the low quality of 
      evidence suggests a need for more rigorous studies to confirm these findings.

AB  - BACKGROUND: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small regulatory molecules that play a 
      critical role in various biological processes by regulating gene expression. They 
      have emerged as crucial players in cancer development, including breast cancer. 
      However, individual research studies may be subject to specific biases. METHODS: 
      To gain a more comprehensive understanding of miRNA involvement in breast cancer, 
      we employed a large-scale analysis of miRNA studies retrieved from PubMed. Our 
      approach involved tokenizing abstracts to identify key biomedical entities (e.g., 
      miRNA, gene, disease) and constructing miRNA-cancer co-occurrence networks using 
      bioinformatic analysis. RESULTS: This analysis revealed miR-21 as the most 
      frequently studied miRNA in breast cancer research, with a significant difference 
      compared to other miRNAs. Network analysis identified SMAD3, PIK3R1, STAT3, and 
      TP53 as key regulators potentially affecting pathways like TGF-beta signaling and 
      p53 signaling. Additionally, our analysis suggests that genes associated with 
      miR-21 are often downregulated in tumors and exhibit a positive correlation with 
      T cell infiltration, particularly CD8+ T cells, potentially indicating a 
      favorable prognosis. CONCLUSION: Our findings highlight miR-21 as a central 
      regulatory hub and potential biomarker in breast cancer. While informative, the 
      results are derived from literature-based data and may be influenced by 
      text-mining limitations, underscoring the need for experimental validation.

      for a Randomized Sham-Controlled Trial.
PG  - e70637
LID - 10.1002/brb3.70637 [doi]
LID - e70637
AB  - BACKGROUND: Treatment of disorders of consciousness (DOC) remains a clinical 
      challenge. Electroacupuncture (EA) was shown to have the potential to promote the 
      recovery of consciousness. This trial aims to explore the therapeutic effects and 
      mechanisms of EA in patients with DOC due to traumatic brain injury (TBI) through 
      a multimodal approach. METHODS: A total of 50 adult patients with DOC due to TBI 
      and 25 healthy subjects will be enrolled in the study. Patients enrolled in the 
      study will be assigned to the EA group or the sham-EA group through stratified 
      randomization. All patients receive behavioral assessments (CRS-R and 
      brain-computer interface), neurophysiological evaluations (EEG, somatosensory 
      evoked potentials, brainstem auditory evoked potentials), and neuroimaging 
      evaluations (rs-fMRI, amide proton transfer, intravoxel incoherent motion, 
      neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging) before and after the 14-day 
      EA or sham-EA treatment. Each healthy subject will receive a set of 
      neurophysiological and neuroimaging examinations but no treatments. The 
      practitioner administering EA and sham-EA is the only one aware of the grouping 
      results. In the sham-EA group, sham-acupoints, sham-acupuncture, and sham-wire 
      are utilized. The primary outcome measurement is the change in CRS-R score after 
      14 days of treatment compared with the baseline CRS-R score. DISCUSSION: The 
      AcuDoc trial will be the first randomized sham-controlled study to investigate 
      the clinical benefits of EA in patients with DOC. This trial will elucidate the 
      role of EA in the treatment of DOC due to TBI and provide evidence of its 
      therapeutic mechanisms.

      Ghana.
LID - 10.1089/vbz.2024.0120 [doi]
AB  - Background: In Ghana, no research has recorded any positive cases of human 
      babesiosis, despite the presence of Babesia reservoir hosts in many Ghanaian 
      communities. Epidemiological studies have reported active infections in these 
      hosts. Thus, this study explored possible cases of human babesiosis in selected 
      major hospitals in the Greater Accra region and assessed the prevalence of 
      Babesia infections in common reservoirs (dogs, cats, and rodents) from households 
      and veterinary institutions. Methods: This cross-sectional study involved 
      retrieving medical records from three major hospitals in urban (University of 
      Ghana Hospital and Pentecost Hospital) and peri-urban (Shai-Osudoku District 
      Hospital) areas that satisfied the eligibility criteria. Analysis of human 
      babesiosis cases was conducted using appropriate search queries in Microsoft 
      Excel. Genomic DNA was also isolated from 404 blood samples from Babesia 
      reservoir hosts, and DNA analysis was performed using PIRO A1 and PIRO B primers 
      targeting 18S rDNA. Results: These hospitals did not record cases of human 
      babesiosis, although several cases of febrile illnesses and malaria were 
      reported. The blood of 326 animals tested positive for Babesia DNA. Thus, the 
      overall prevalence of Babesia infection in sampled animals was 80.69% (326/404), 
      with infection prevalence varying among the targeted reservoir hosts: 53.07% 
      (173/326) dogs, 3.99% (13/326) cats, and 42.9% (140/326) rodents. Conclusion: 
      Although the hospitals documented no cases of human babesiosis, Babesia 
      transmission was active among reservoir hosts. Therefore, clinicians and 
      laboratory scientists in the Greater Accra region and Ghana should maintain a 
      high index of suspicion of human babesiosis to avoid missing such cases.

      mice by improving mitochondrial function].
PG  - 419-431
LID - 10.13294/j.aps.2025.0049 [doi]
AB  - Parkinson's disease (PD) is a common neurodegenerative disorder mainly related to 
      mitochondrial dysfunction of dopaminergic neurons in the midbrain substantia 
      nigra. This study aimed to investigate the effects of exercise preconditioning on 
      motor deficits and mitochondrial function in a 
      1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP)-induced PD mouse model. 
      Eight-week-old male C57BL/6J mice were randomly divided into four groups: 
      sedentary + saline (SS), sedentary + MPTP (SM), exercise + saline (ES), and 
      exercise + MPTP (EM) groups. Mice in the ES and EM groups received 4 weeks of 
      treadmill training, and then SM and EM groups were treated with MPTP for 5 days. 
      Motor function was assessed by behavioral tests, and morphological and functional 
      changes in dopaminergic neurons and mitochondria in the substantia nigra of the 
      midbrain were evaluated using immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and 
      transmission electron microscopy technology. The results showed that, compared 
      with the SM group, the EM group exhibited significantly improved motor ability, 
      up-regulated protein expression levels of tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) and dopamine 
      transporter (DAT) in the midbrain, and down-regulated protein expression of 
      alpha-synuclein (alpha-Syn) in the mitochondria of substantia nigra. Compared with the SM 
      group, the EM group showed up-regulated protein expression levels of 
      mitochondrial fusion proteins, including optical atrophy protein 1 (OPA1) and 
      mitofusin 2 (MFN2), and biogenesis-related proteins, including peroxisome 
      proliferator activated receptor gamma coactivator 1alpha (PGC-1alpha) and mitochondrial 
      transcription factor A (TFAM), while the protein expression levels of 
      dynamin-related protein 1 (DRP1) and mitochondrial fission protein 1 (FIS1) were 
      significantly down-regulated. Compared with the SM group, the EM group showed 
      significantly reduced damage to substantia nigra mitochondria, restored 
      mitochondrial membrane potential and ATP production, and decreased levels of 
      reactive oxygen species (ROS). These results suggest that 4-week treadmill 
      pre-training can alleviate MPTP-induced motor impairments in PD mice by improving 
      mitochondrial function, providing a theoretical basis for early exercise-based 
      prevention of PD.

TI  - Use of Non-Pharmacological Approaches for Migraine Treatment: Results from the 
      Migraine in Aotearoa New Zealand Survey.
LID - 10.3390/jcm14124023 [doi]
LID - 4023
AB  - Background/Objectives: Migraine is a common neurological disease with a high 
      disability burden. Despite this, many people with migraine do not take medication 
      to prevent attacks, even when this is indicated. Many non-pharmacological 
      approaches to migraine treatment exist, but little is known about how people with 
      migraine use these options. Methods: The online Migraine in Aotearoa New Zealand 
      (NZ) Survey collected responses from 530 people with migraine from August to 
      October 2022. Questions included current and previous use of preventive 
      medications, supplements (e.g., magnesium, riboflavin, coenzyme Q10) and 
      complementary therapies (e.g., meditation, biofeedback, yoga, acupuncture). 
      Results: Around half of the respondents were currently using a supplement, 58% 
      were currently using complementary therapy and half were taking preventive 
      medication. One in five were using all three approaches for migraine prevention. 
      Of those not taking preventive medication, 44% were taking a supplement, and 53% 
      were using complementary therapy. For commonly used non-pharmacological 
      approaches, 20-30% of people had tried them in the past but stopped due to lack 
      of efficacy or other reasons. A high proportion of people would like to try 
      approaches that are not readily available or expensive in NZ (e.g., 
      neurostimulation devices and biofeedback). Conclusions: The use of supplements 
      and complementary therapies for migraine prevention is common, often in 
      combination with medication. There are high levels of discontinuation due to 
      ineffectiveness and cost prohibits use for many. Improved access to 
      non-pharmacological therapies, particularly as an adjunct, has the potential to 
      improve outcomes for people with migraine, but more and better migraine treatment 
      options are also needed.

TI  - Pain and Disability Reduction Following Rib Manipulation in a Patient Recovering 
      from Osteomyelitis of the Thoracic Spine.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare13121355 [doi]
LID - 1355
AB  - Introduction: Spinal thrust manipulation has been found useful for improving pain 
      and mobility in musculoskeletal conditions of the thoracic spine. This case 
      report highlights the importance of incorporating high-velocity low-amplitude 
      (HVLA) thrust manipulation to the mid-thoracic rib articulations in a patient 
      experiencing thoracic spine pain associated with an acute onset of osteomyelitis 
      at levels T7-T9. Detailed Case Description: A 49-year-old female who was 
      recovering from osteomyelitis of the thoracic spine 4 months prior was referred 
      to physical therapy by her neurosurgeon. Her osteomyelitis infection resulted in 
      a bone-on-bone interaction between T7 and T9, resulting in significant thoracic 
      spine pain. Severe restrictions in active range of motion (AROM) were found in 
      extension and right and left rotation. At initial evaluation, the patient's pain 
      intensity score was 8/10 (NPRS, 0-10), the disability score was 46/50 (NDI, 
      0-50), and the patient-specific functional scale score was 3/10 (PSFS, 0-10). 
      Initially, interventions included grades I-IV posterior to anterior (PA) 
      mobilizations of the thoracic spine from levels T2 to T9, mobilization with 
      movement of the thoracic spine for extension and rotation bilaterally, scapular 
      stabilization, and thoracic mobility exercises. Treatment progressed to HVLA 
      thrust manipulation techniques targeting the costotransverse articulations of 
      ribs 2-9. Discussion: Following the initial eight treatment sessions over 4 
      weeks, minimal improvement was observed for pain (NPRS from 8/10 to 6/10), 
      disability (NDI from 46/50 to 34/50), and thoracic extension AROM (13 degrees ). However, 
      during visits 9-16, the addition of HVLA thrust manipulation targeting the 
      costotransverse articulations resulted in significant improvements in pain, 
      disability, and AROM. The patient was subsequently discharged after 16 visits and 
      able to return to a full workday as a teacher without any thoracic pain or ROM 
      restrictions. At the 6-month follow-up, the patient outcomes remained, and she 
      was working with no restrictions. Conclusion: The addition of HVLA thrust 
      manipulation targeting the mid-thoracic rib articulations to a program of 
      non-thrust mobilization and exercise appeared useful for improving pain, 
      disability, and range of motion in a patient recovering from osteomyelitis of the 
      thoracic spine.

TI  - Extracellular Vesicles as Targeted Communicators in Complementary Medical 
      Treatments.
LID - 10.3390/ijms26125896 [doi]
LID - 5896
AB  - The supposed meridians of traditional oriental medicine have been a cause of 
      conflict between traditional and modern medical science. A possible resolution 
      has been proposed: That extracellular vesicles, including exosomes, may be the 
      transmitters of traditional therapies such as massage and acupuncture. This 
      article develops that idea by proposing that the pathways between surface and 
      deep structures may be laid down during the embryonic migration of cells from one 
      region of the developing body to distant regions. This hypothesis depends on the 
      proven targeting of vesicular communication via cell surface binding molecules 
      and their complementary binding sites on target cells. The hypothesis is 
      therefore experimentally testable. The article also draws attention to a strong 
      analogy with Charles Darwin's theory of pangenesis for particulate communication 
      between the soma and germline.

TI  - Combination Therapy of Half-Dose Resmetirom and Metformin Attenuates Metabolic 
      Dysfunction-Associated Steatohepatitis Through Improving Cholesterol Metabolism 
      and Inflammation.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines13061315 [doi]
LID - 1315
AB  - Background/Objectives: Metabolic dysfunction-associated steatohepatitis (MASH) 
      has become the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma and liver disorders 
      globally. Nevertheless, only one expensive drug, resmetirom (Res), has been 
      approved by the FDA for MASH treatment to date. However, its high price has 
      imposed a heavy financial burden on patients. Methods: In this study, half-dose 
      Res and low-dose metformin (Met) (referred to as RM) were administered in 
      combination to treat MASH models in vitro and in vivo. We utilized transcriptome 
      and lipidomics sequencing to assess the efficacy of RM in improving MASH. Our 
      goal was to systemically compare the therapeutic effects of RM, Met, and Res on 
      MASH and elucidate the underlying mechanisms. Results: Our results demonstrated 
      that RM was comparable to Res and superior to Met in reducing lipid production in 
      vitro, attenuating lipid accumulation, inhibiting inflammation, and improving 
      fibrosis in vivo. Transcriptome and lipidome analyses further revealed that RM 
      regulated the expression of genes and lipids in a manner similar to Res, 
      particularly in pathways related to cholesterol metabolism and inflammation. 
      Further validation showed that RM facilitated cholesterol transformation by 
      robustly promoting the expression of CYP7A1, thereby mitigating MASH. 
      Conclusions: Collectively, our findings highlight that a combination of half-dose 
      Res and Met is equivalent to Res alone in terms of MASH treatment efficacy. This 
      study provides a novel therapeutic strategy that is not only effective for MASH 
      treatment but also reduces the economic burden on patients.

LID - 10.3390/biology14060637 [doi]
LID - 637
AB  - Baicalin, a kind of polyphenolic flavonoid, is a major bioactive flavone derived 
      from the root of Scutellaria baicalensis, which has been widely utilized in 
      clinical practice in China for thousands of years. In recent years, it has 
      attracted increasing attention due to its potential therapeutic properties 
      observed in preclinical studies involving various disease models. However, the 
      precise mechanisms underlying its biological activities have not been fully 
      elucidated. This review summarizes recent research progress on the molecular 
      mechanisms through which baicalin exerts its effects, particularly in tumor 
      suppression, cardiovascular protection, neuronal preservation, and glucose and 
      lipid metabolism regulation in murine models. Additionally, we discuss the 
      delivery methods of baicalin and its transformation by intestinal microbiota.

AB  - Thermosensitive hydrogel, as a smart polymer material, showed great potential for 
      application in the field of wound repair due to its unique external temperature 
      responsiveness and excellent biocompatibility. Chitosan, a natural macromolecular 
      polysaccharide derived from the deacetylation of chitin, possessed not only 
      strong interactions with biomolecules such as DNA, proteins, and lipids, but also 
      unique biocompatibility and degradability. Chitosan-based thermosensitive 
      hydrogels, prepared by compounding chitosan with surfactants, underwent sol-gel 
      phase transitions at varying external temperatures, which provided an ideal 
      healing environment for wounds. This comprehensive review was initiated by 
      elucidating the sol-gel phase transformation mechanism underlying thermosensitive 
      hydrogels and the intricate process of wound repair. In addition, this review 
      provided a detailed overview of the prevalent types of chitosan-based 
      thermosensitive hydrogels, highlighting their unique characteristics and 
      applications in different types of wound repair. Finally, the challenges and 
      development directions of chitosan-based thermosensitive hydrogels in wound 
      repair were discussed, aiming to provide theoretical support and practical 
      guidance for their future applications in wound healing.

TI  - Epileptic Seizure Detection Using Machine Learning: A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.3390/brainsci15060634 [doi]
LID - 634
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Epileptic seizures significantly impact patients' lives 
      due to their unpredictability, making early and accurate detection crucial for 
      effective treatment. Machine learning (ML) models based on electroencephalogram 
      (EEG) signals have been explored for automated seizure detection. This 
      meta-analysis reviews the performance of ML models in seizure detection and 
      analyzes factors such as the model type (deep learning vs. traditional ML), data 
      preprocessing methods, and dataset types. AIM: This study aims to provide an 
      evidence-based foundation for the future development of intelligent tools by 
      evaluating the performance of ML models in detecting epileptic seizures through a 
      meta-analysis. METHODS: A systematic search of multiple databases up to April 
      2025 identified 60 studies and 93 datasets. The pooled sensitivity, specificity, 
      and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated using Stata 17.0. Subgroup 
      analyses were performed to identify sources of heterogeneity. Publication bias 
      was assessed using Deek's test and funnel plots. RESULTS: The pooled sensitivity, 
      specificity, and AUC were 0.96 (95% CI 0.95-0.97), 0.97 (95% CI 0.96-0.98), and 
      0.99 (95% CI 0.98-1.00), respectively, indicating a good performance of ML in 
      seizure detection. Subgroup analyses revealed that the model type, data 
      preprocessing methods, and dataset type contributed to heterogeneity. 
      CONCLUSIONS: ML shows a strong potential for EEG-based seizure detection. Imaging 
      devices integrating ML may serve as effective tools for early epilepsy diagnosis. 
      However, larger, multicenter clinical studies are needed to validate these 
      algorithms and enhance their interpretability, safety, and applicability in 
      real-world clinical settings.

TI  - Antimicrobial and Antiradical Activity of Extracts from Leaves of Various 
      Cultivars of Pyrus communis and Pyrus pyrifolia.
LID - 10.3390/biom15060821 [doi]
LID - 821
AB  - Certain plant raw materials are rich in antioxidant and antimicrobial compounds, 
      which are highly valued in modern medicine. These include the leaves of various 
      species and cultivars of pears. For our research, we chose the leaves of the 
      common pear (Pyrus communis) and Asian pear (Pyrus pyrifolia). Four different 
      extracts were obtained from all raw materials and were investigated for their 
      antimicrobial and antioxidant activity. The content of total phenolics and 
      flavonoids was measured using colorimetric methods, and antiradical activity was 
      measured using DPPH and ABTS radical probes. The antimicrobial activity of 
      extracts was measured using the disc diffusion method, and the amount of major 
      antimicrobial components (hydroquinone and arbutin) was measured using the HPLC 
      method. The highest amount of general phenols and flavonoids was found in ethyl 
      acetate extracts in all cultivars, and the lowest amount of phenols was found in 
      the remaining aqueous solution. The amount of general phenols positively 
      correlated with the antiradical activity of extracts. The strongest antimicrobial 
      activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative pathogens corresponded to the 
      highest content of hydroquinone and arbutin in ethyl acetate extracts. Extracts 
      obtained from pear leaves showed an average content of phenolic compounds and 
      average antiradical activity compared to extracts from other raw materials, 
      especially green tea or bergenia leaves. The amount of hydroquinone was moderate, 
      lower than that of arbutin. The antimicrobial activity of the extracts was 
      moderate due to the average amount of hydroquinone, which is the main 
      antimicrobial compound.

TI  - Proteomic Study Between Interstitial Channels Along Meridians and Adjacent Areas 
      in Mini-Pigs.
LID - 10.3390/biom15060804 [doi]
LID - 804
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study explores the material basis and biological functions of 
      meridian interstitial channels in mini-pigs proximal to the stomach meridian by 
      analyzing differential proteomics between interstitial channels and adjacent 
      non-interstitial channel tissues. METHODS: Liquid chromatography-mass 
      spectrometry (LC-MS) under data-dependent acquisition mode was employed to 
      analyze and identify the proteome of subcutaneous connective tissues along the 
      stomach meridian and adjacent tissues. SWATH MS(ALL) method and omicsbean online 
      analysis platforms were used for protein quantification and differential 
      proteomic analysis. Differential proteins were subjected to Gene Ontology 
      annotation and KEGG pathway analysis to understand their functions and biological 
      processes. Combining traditional Chinese meridian theory with modern meridian 
      research, proteins most relevant to meridian functions were selected, and their 
      expression levels were assessed using Western blotting. RESULTS: GO annotation 
      and KEGG pathway analysis revealed differences in molecular functions, biological 
      processes, and metabolic pathways among differential proteins. Most downregulated 
      proteins were enzyme functional proteins involved in amino acid metabolism 
      (GOT1), adenosine nucleotide balance conversion (AK1), and calcium ion-binding 
      processes (ANXA6). Most upregulated proteins were structural proteins in the 
      extracellular matrix-collagen proteins (COL3A1, COL6A1, COL6A3, COL6A6, COL12A1, 
      COL14A1) and proteoglycans (DCN, BGN, FMOD)-involved in influencing and 
      regulating collagen fiber generation and arrangement. Intriguingly, almost all 
      differential proteins were associated with gastrointestinal diseases, implying a 
      pathological correlation of differential proteins in the stomach meridian 
      interstitial channel. CONCLUSIONS: The stomach meridian interstitial channels in 
      mini-pigs show 72 differentially expressed proteins compared to adjacent tissues. 
      These differences include the upregulation of structural proteins and 
      downregulation of functional proteins, potentially forming the molecular 
      biological basis for the structural and functional specificity of meridians.

TI  - gammadeltaT Cells in IBD: Beneficial or Detrimental?
LID - 10.1111/imm.70012 [doi]
AB  - gammadeltaT cells play a crucial role in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). Studies have 
      shown that the number, subsets and secreted cytokines of gammadeltaT cells undergo 
      changes in IBD. However, whether gammadeltaT cells are beneficial or detrimental in IBD 
      remains controversial. Some studies suggest that gammadeltaT cells have a protective role 
      in colitis, while others indicate that the expansion and activation of gammadeltaT cells 
      may exacerbate colitis. Several studies have explored gammadeltaT cell-based therapies 
      for immune disorders, and gammadeltaT cell-based therapy for IBD has emerged as a 
      promising research direction. There are numerous reviews of gammadeltaT cells and 
      autoimmune diseases, but few reviews focus on gammadeltaT and IBD. Therefore, this 
      article briefly summarises the current understanding of gammadeltaT cells in IBD.

AB  - Anxiety occurs in the early stage of cognitive disorders, which can exacerbate 
      cognitive impairment. However, the pathogenesis of this kind of anxiety remains 
      unclear. In this study, we investigated anxiety-like behaviors in young adult 
      presenilin 1/2 conditional double knockout (PS cDKO) mice, a model of progressive 
      cognitive impairment, using behavioral tests and electrophysiological recordings. 
      Disrupted excitatory/inhibitory (E/I) balance was observed in pyramidal neurons 
      (PNs) of the ventral hippocampus (vHPC) CA1 (vCA1) region of PS cDKO mice. 
      Meanwhile, PV + interneurons showed hypoexcitability, associated with increased 
      outward K(+) currents due to elevated Kv1.1 potassium channel levels. 
      Importantly, genetic or pharmacological inhibition of Kv1.1 restored 
      PV + interneuron activity and reduced anxiety-like behaviors. These findings 
      highlight a role of Kv1.1 in controlling PV + interneuron excitability, 
      suggesting that targeting Kv1.1 in vCA1 PV + interneurons could mitigate anxiety 
      in early-stage cognitive dysfunction.

TI  - Acupuncture activates vagus nerve-macrophage axis and improves cardiac 
      electrophysiology and inflammatory response in rats with atrial fibrillation via 
      alpha7nAChR-JAK2/STAT3 pathway.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: The occurrence and development of atrial fibrillation (AF) are 
      influenced by the autonomic nervous system and inflammation. Acupuncture is an 
      effective treatment for AF. This study explored the protective effects of 
      acupuncture in a rat model of paroxysmal AF and investigated its mechanisms. 
      METHODS: Male Sprague-Dawley rats (n = 130) were randomly divided into blank 
      control (Con), sham operation (Sham), AF, and acupuncture treatment (Acu) groups. 
      A paroxysmal AF model was established by rapid atrial pacing through the jugular 
      vein. Rats in the Acu group were immobilized to receive acupuncture treatment at 
      Neiguan acupoint (PC6) for 20 min daily for seven days. The other groups were 
      immobilized for the same duration over the treatment period but did not receive 
      acupuncture. The AF induction rate, AF duration, cardiac electrophysiological 
      parameters, and heart rate variability were evaluated by monitoring surface 
      electrocardiogram and vagus nerve discharge signals. After the intervention, the 
      rats were euthanized, and atrial morphology was assessed using haematoxylin and 
      eosin staining. The expression of macrophage F4/80 antigen (F4/80) and cluster of 
      differentiation (CD) 86 in atrial myocardial tissue was detected using 
      immunohistochemistry, immunofluorescence and flow cytometry. The expression 
      levels or contents of interleukin (IL)-1beta, IL-6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), 
      alpha7 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (alpha7nAChR), phosphorylated Janus kinase 2 
      (p-JAK2), and phosphorylated signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 
      (p-STAT3) in atrial myocardial tissue were detected using Western blotting, 
      reverse transcription-quantitative polymerase chain reaction, or enzyme-linked 
      immunosorbent assay. The role of alpha7nAChR in acupuncture treatment was verified by 
      intraperitoneal injection of the alpha7nAChR antagonist methyllycaconitine (MLA). 
      RESULTS: Compared with the AF group, acupuncture significantly reduced AF 
      duration and induction rate, improved cardiac electrophysiology by enhancing 
      vagus nerve activity and regulating autonomic balance. It also decreased the 
      pro-inflammatory M1 macrophage proportion, alleviating myocardial injury and 
      infiltration. MLA weakened acupuncture's electrophysiological improvement and 
      anti-inflammatory effect. Results suggest that acupuncture triggers the 
      alpha7nAChR-JAK2/STAT3 pathway and exerts cardioprotection via neuroimmune 
      regulation. CONCLUSION: Acupuncture significantly reduced the AF induction rate, 
      shortened AF duration, improved cardiac electrophysiological parameters, enhanced 
      vagus nerve activity, and decreased the expression of pro-inflammatory M1 
      macrophages and inflammatory factors in rats with paroxysmal AF. Its positive 
      effects are related to the activation of the alpha7nAChR-mediated JAK2/STAT3 
      signalling pathway, indicating that the interaction between cardiac vagus nerve 
      and macrophages may be a potential target for acupuncture in the prevention and 
      treatment of AF. Please cite this article as: Li ZH, Yang WM, Huang Q, Shi GX,

AB  - Existing reporting checklists lack the specificity and comprehensiveness required 
      to effectively guide the documentation of acupuncture case reports. Therefore, we 
      developed a reporting guideline tailored specifically for acupuncture case 
      reports, building upon the CAse REport (CARE) statement. A multidisciplinary 
      group of international experts including clinicians, researchers and 
      methodologists was convened to draft the initial checklist in accordance with the 
      methodology recommended by the Enhancing the QUAlity and Transparency Of health 
      Research (EQUATOR) network. Through an extensive literature review and a series 
      of expert interviews, the final CARE for acupuncture checklist comprised of 30 
      items. 38 experts from diverse disciplines participated in three rounds of 
      modified Delphi surveys to refine and clarify these items. CARE for acupuncture 
      is a comprehensive reporting guideline focused on acupuncture case reports 
      developed with rigorous methodology. We hope that CARE for acupuncture will 
      further guide authors, editors, peer reviewers and readers to enhance the 
      transparency, completeness and accuracy of reporting of case reports in 
      acupuncture.

AB  - ETHNOPHARMACOLOGICAL RELEVANCE: Mulberry leaves (Morus alba L.) are used in 
      traditional Chinese medicine to clear the lungs and dispel wind-heat. Despite 
      their common use, chemical reference substance rely solely on rutin, which may 
      not reflect their full pharmacological potential. AIM OF THE STUDY: To develop a 
      multicomponent quality evaluation strategy for mulberry leaves by integrating 
      HPLC fingerprinting, chemometrics, and biological validation. MATERIALS AND 
      METHODS: Twenty-seven mulberry leaf samples were analyzed using HPLC. PCA, 
      PLS-DA, and Pearson correlation were applied to identify quality markers. An 
      artificial neural network (ANN) model was constructed based on 17 characteristic 
      peaks. Anti-fibrotic effects were evaluated in bleomycin-induced pulmonary 
      fibrosis mice. RESULTS: Based on the distribution of chemical reference 
      substances contents in the 27 samples, the mulberry leaves could be categorized 
      into high- and low-content groups, with 0.1% rutin serving as the classification 
      threshold. An ANN analysis of the HPLC fingerprint was then employed to establish 
      a recognition model based on the full fingerprint, achieving a classification 
      accuracy of 100%. Rutin correlated with MMP-13 inhibition, and cryptochlorogenic 
      acid with both MMP-13 and PAI-1 inhibition. In vivo studies demonstrated that 
      qualified extracts of mulberry leaves reduced the progression of 
      bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis. CONCLUSIONS: This study establishes a 
      comprehensive and bioactivity-linked quality evaluation framework for mulberry 
      leaves, aligning traditional knowledge with modern scientific assessment.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To investigate the effect of ecliptasaponin A (ESA) for alleviating 
      dextran sulfate sodium (DSS)-induced inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) in mice and 
      the underlying mechanism. METHODS: Twenty-four male C57BL/6 mice (8-10 weeks old) 
      were equally randomized into control group, DSS-induced IBD model group, and 
      DSS+ESA (50 mg/kg) treatment group. Disease activity index (DAI), colon length 
      and spleen index of the mice were measured, and intestinal pathology was examined 
      with HE staining. The expressions of inflammatory mediators (TNF-alpha, IL-6, and 
      iNOS) in the colon mucosa were detected using ELISA and RT-qPCR, and intestinal 
      barrier integrity was assessed using AB-PAS staining and by detecting ZO-1 and 
      claudin-1 expressions using immunofluorescence staining and Western blotting. In 
      cultured RAW264.7 macrophages, the effects of treatment with 50 mumol/L ESA, alone 
      or in combination with 20 mumol/L RO8191 (a JAK2/STAT3 pathway activator), on M1 
      polarization of the cells induced by LPS and IFN-gamma stimulation and expressions of 
      JAK2/STAT3 pathway proteins were analyzed using flow cytometry and Western 
      blotting. RESULTS: In the mouse models of DSS-induced IBD, ESA treatment 
      significantly alleviated body weight loss and colon shortening, reduced DAI, 
      spleen index and histological scores, and ameliorated inflammatory cell 
      infiltration in the colon tissue. ESA treatment also suppressed TNF‑alpha, IL-6 and 
      iNOS expressions, protected the goblet cells and the integrity of the mucus and 
      mechanical barriers, and upregulated the expressions of ZO-1 and claudin-1. ESA 
      treatment obviously decreased CD86(+) M1 polarization in the mesenteric lymph 
      nodes of IBD mice and in LPS and IFN-gamma-induced RAW264.7 cells, and significantly 
      reduced p-JAK2 and p-STAT3 expressions in both the mouse models and RAW264.7 
      cells. Treatment with RO8191 caused reactivation of JAK2/STAT3 and strongly 
      attenuated the inhibitory effect of ESA on CD86(+) polarization in RAW264.7 
      cells. CONCLUSIONS: ESA alleviates DSS-induced colitis in mice by suppressing 
      JAK2/STAT3-mediated M1 macrophage polarization and mitigating inflammation-driven 
      intestinal barrier damage.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore the therapeutic mechanism of Arctium lappa extract for 
      treatment of Post-Viral Pneumonia Pulmonary Fibrosis (PPF). METHODS: The chemical 
      constituents of Arctium lappa extracts were identified using UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS/MS. 
      Mouse models of pulmonary fibrosis established by tracheal instillation of 
      bleomycin were treated with Arctium lappa extract, and body weight changes were 
      recorded and lung tissue pathology was examined using HE and Masson staining. 
      Metabolomics analysis was used to identify the differential metabolites and the 
      associated metabolic pathways in the treated mice. The common targets of viral 
      pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis were acquired from the publicly available 
      databases, and the core targets and active constituents were screened using the 
      protein-protein interaction (PPI) network, GO and KEGG enrichment analyses, and 
      molecular docking, and a ""gene-metabolite"" regulatory network was constructed. 
      The expressions of the core targets were detected in the lung tissues of the 
      treated mice using Western blotting. RESULTS: Fifty-three chemical constituents 
      were identified from Arctium lappa extract. In the mouse models of pulmonary 
      fibrosis, treatment with Arctium lappa extract significantly improved weight loss 
      and ameliorated lung inflammation and fibrosis. The differential metabolites in 
      the treated mice were enriched in energy metabolism pathways involving citrate 
      cycle, pentose phosphate pathway, glycolysis, tryptophan metabolism, glutamate 
      metabolism and glutathione metabolism, which regulated the production of energy 
      metabolism intermediates. Twenty-three key active compounds (mostly lignans and 
      phenolic acids) and 82 core targets were screened, which were associated with the 
      non-canonical Smad signaling pathways (including PI3K/AKT, HIF-1, MAPK, and Foxo) 
      that participated in the regulation of energy metabolism. Arctium lappa extract 
      also regulated the expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT)‑related 
      proteins (fibronectin, vimentim, and Snail, etc.) and inhibited MAPK signaling 
      pathway activation. CONCLUSIONS: Preliminary findings suggest that Arctium lappa 
      treats fibrosis by regulating metabolism to inhibit EMT and involves the 
      modulation of non-canonical Smad signaling pathways, such as MAPK providing 
      theoretical support for its clinical application and further research in treating 
      PPF.

AB  - The present study aims to encapsulate Illicium verum essential oil (IVEO) into 
      chitosan nanoemulsion (IVNPs) using different ratios of chitosan: IVEO (1:0, 
      1:0.2, 1:0.4, 1:0.6, 1:0.8, 1:1) through the ionic gelation approach and evaluate 
      its efficacy as a novel coating agent with a unique delivery system to protect 
      custard apples from fungi-mediated post-harvest biodeterioration and to enhance 
      their shelf-life. The chitosan nanoemulsion and IVNPs were characterized using 
      SEM, AFM, and DLS to observe their morphology, mean particle size, and 
      polydispersity index. The results showed spherical nanocapsules with a uniform 
      distribution. FTIR and XRD analysis showed effective loading of IVEO into IVNPs. 
      The antifungal efficacy of IVEO against Aspergillus flavus (AFLHP-C3), A. 
      luchuensis, A. niger, Fusarium chlamydosporum, Penicillium expansum, 
      Colletotrichum acutatum, Curvularia lunata, and mycelia sterilia was enhanced 
      after its encapsulation into the chitosan biomatrix (MIC values recorded as 0.1, 
      0.7, 0.8, 0.2, 0.8, 0.4, 0.25, 0.2 muL/mL, respectively). The fungal plasma 
      membrane was detected as a potential target site of IVNPs. Furthermore, IVNPs 
      coating (1:1) was able to preserve the rate of weight loss, pH, titrable acidity, 
      total soluble solids, phenolic content, antioxidant capacity (p < 0.05), and 
      sensorial attributes of custard apples during post-harvest storage, thereby 
      acting as a novel coating agent.

AB  - A series of novel 2,4-diarylaminopyrimidine derivatives incorporating a 
      3-sulfamoylbenzamide moiety were designed and synthesized as potent focal 
      adhesion kinase (FAK) inhibitors. Three compounds (5f, 10b, and 10c) demonstrated 
      FAK inhibitory activities comparable to the reference inhibitor TAE226. In 
      cellular assays, most analogues exhibited significant antiproliferative effects 
      against four FAK-overexpressing tumor cell lines (HCT116, HeLa, MDA-MB-231, and 
      A375), with IC(50) values below 1 muM. Notably, compound 10c displayed superior 
      potency, showing IC(50) values ranging from 0.08 to 0.31 muM across the tested 
      cell lines, and exhibited approximately 2-fold enhanced activity over TAE226 in 
      inhibiting HCT116, MDA-MB-231, and A375 cell proliferation. Further mechanistic 
      studies revealed that 10c effectively suppressed colony formation, migration, and 
      adhesion of HCT116 cells, while inducing apoptosis via ROS elevation. Molecular 
      docking analysis suggested that the enhanced activity of 10c may arise from an 
      additional hydrogen bond interaction with the Arg426 residue of FAK, leading to 
      stronger binding affinity compared to TAE226. In vivo, 10c showed good oral 
      bioavailability and significantly inhibited HCT116 xenograft tumor growth 
      (TGI = 62.22 % at 50 mg/kg), outperforming TAE226 (50.98 %) without inducing 
      weight loss or hepatorenal toxicity. These results highlight 10c as a promising 
      FAK-targeted candidate worthy of further preclinical investigation.

AB  - Heart failure (HF) is a progressive disease characterized by persistent or 
      episodic worsening of symptoms, leading to functional deterioration. Clinically, 
      guidelines recommend the use of SGLT2 inhibitors for the treatment of heart 
      failure. However, the SGLT2 inhibitors exist potential risks including weight 
      loss and euglycemic diabetic ketoacidosis. We designed and synthesized a series 
      of O-glucoside derivatives by introducing nitrogen-containing heterocyclic 
      fragments. Among them, compound E9 showed the most protective effect on the 
      glucose-free DMEM-induced injured cardiomyocytes, and the structure-activity 
      relationships (SAR) of these compounds were preliminarily evaluated in 
      cardiomyocyte injury model. Furthermore, compound E9 significantly enhanced the 
      inhibition of SGLT2, NHE1, and SOD enzyme activity, increased ATP levels in 
      damaged cardiomyocytes, and suppressed Ang II-induced myocardial fibrosis, the 
      autophagy receptor protein P62 and the expression of cell injury markers. 
      Additionally, compound E9 significantly improved cardiac function in TAC-induced 
      HF mice, inhibited cardiomyocyte hypertrophy and collagen deposition, ameliorated 
      myocardial tissue damage, enhanced mitochondrial autophagy in injured 
      cardiomyocytes, and ultimately increased survival rates in HF mice. In 
      conclusion, this study reveals that the novel O-glucoside derivative E9 was a 
      promising compound for the treatment of heart failure.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Pediatric liver cirrhosis is a rare condition but can lead to 
      significant morbidity and mortality. Congenital or metabolic disorders often 
      cause it. Early diagnosis is critical to prevent progression to advanced stages. 
      This case report highlights the diagnostic challenges of pediatric liver 
      cirrhosis, particularly in resource-limited settings. CASE PRESENTATION: A 
      16-month-old male presented with fever, abdominal distension, poor feeding, 
      weight loss, and diarrhea. On examination, he exhibited jaundice, splenomegaly, 
      and ascites. Laboratory investigations revealed pancytopenia and mildly elevated 
      liver enzymes, while abdominal ultrasound showed cirrhotic changes in the liver 
      and signs of portal hypertension. The patient was managed with blood 
      transfusions, antimalarial therapy, and nutritional support, leading to clinical 
      stabilization. DISCUSSION: Pediatric cirrhosis often goes undiagnosed until 
      complications such as portal hypertension develop. The differential diagnosis 
      includes malnutrition, which can present with similar clinical features. While 
      congenital and metabolic disorders are common causes in younger children, older 
      children may develop cirrhosis due to conditions like autoimmune hepatitis or 
      other metabolic diseases. Nutritional management is essential, as malnutrition 
      can exacerbate liver disease. Imaging studies are helpful for diagnosis, but 
      liver biopsy remains the gold standard for confirmation. CONCLUSION: Early 
      diagnosis of pediatric cirrhosis is vital for effective treatment. In 
      resource-limited settings, improving access to diagnostic tools and prioritizing 
      nutritional support are key disease management components.

TI  - Exploring the Molecular Mechanisms of Ocimum tenuiflorum Linn. Against Crohn's 
      Disease: A Network Pharmacology and Molecular Modelling Approach.

AB  - Crohn's disease is a chronic inflammatory condition of the gastrointestinal tract 
      with symptoms like abdominal pain, diarrhoea and weight loss. Current treatments, 
      including 5-aminosalicylic acid and immunosuppressant, often have side effects 
      and limited efficacy. Alternatively, herbal medication, particularly Ocimum 
      tenuiflorum, has gained attention for its historical use in Ayurveda against 
      gastrointestinal and renal issues, supported by its anti-inflammatory, 
      antioxidant, antimicrobial, and immune-modulatory properties. This study employs 
      network pharmacology and molecular modelling to explore the multi-target and 
      multi-pathway mechanisms of O. tenuiflorum as a complementary therapeutic 
      approach for addressing Crohn's disease. The ADME screening of O. tenuiflorum 
      identified 24 compounds with 550 targets and 5142 CD unique disease genes were 
      found. Overlapping revealed 259 common targets and helped to identify the top 10 
      potential targets. Enrichment analysis indicated O. tenuiflorum's management 
      potential via PI3K-AKT pathway modulation. Furthermore, molecular modelling 
      revealed synergistic effects of O. tenuiflorum with identified key targets. Our 
      study demonstrates the multi-target (AKT1, MAPK3, PIK3R1, SRC and STAT3) and 
      multi-pathway (PI3K-AKT, Jak-STAT, MAPK and mTOR signalling) mechanisms of O. 
      tenuiflorum in combating CD, providing new insight for further research towards 
      developing complementary therapies.

TI  - Long-term outcomes of laparoscopic duodenojejunostomy for superior mesenteric 
      artery syndrome.
LID - 10.1007/s00464-025-11774-6 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Superior mesenteric artery syndrome (SMAS) is caused by partial 
      obstruction of the duodenum between the SMA and the aorta. While laparoscopic 
      duodenojejunostomy (DJ) shows favorable short- and intermediate-term outcomes, 
      characterization of long-term outcomes remains limited. METHODS AND PROCEDURES: 
      An IRB-approved retrospective study was conducted on patients who underwent 
      laparoscopic DJ from January 2007 to January 2023 at our center. SMAS diagnosis 
      was confirmed through clinical presentation and radiographic studies. Data on 
      BMI, symptoms, and nutritional support were collected preoperatively and at last 
      follow-up. A McNemar test was performed to compare preoperative and long-term 
      outcomes. RESULTS: Twenty-five patients (median age 32.1 years, IQR 23.2-45.3) 
      with a median follow-up of 5.3 years (IQR 3.0-8.5) were identified. BMI increased 
      from median of 19.2 kg/m(2) (IQR 17.8-21.1) to 21.6 kg/m(2) (IQR 18.0-23.8) at 
      the time of last follow-up (p = 0.005). The number of patients dependent on 
      enteral tube feeds and total parenteral nutrition decreased within this time 
      frame (36.0% to 28.0%, p = 0.4795). Fewer patients underwent procedures for 
      enteral access placement preoperatively than by the time of last follow-up (36.0% 
      to 12.0%, p = 0.1573). Abdominal pain (p < 0.001), nausea (p < 0.001), vomiting 
      (p = 0.3657), bloating (p = 0.2568), and weight loss (p < 0.001) decreased within 
      this time frame. No significant changes were observed in antiemetic (p = 0.7389) 
      or prokinetic (p = 0.5637) use. Seven patients (28.0%) required major surgical 
      interventions for diagnoses of gastrointestinal motility disorders. Four of these 
      patients (16.0%) died during the final follow-up period. CONCLUSION: Laparoscopic 
      DJ shows long-term benefits for SMAS, including improved BMI, reduced 
      supplemental feeding dependence, and significant symptom relief, particularly for 
      pain, nausea, and vomiting. However, a significant proportion of patients with 
      concurrent gastrointestinal motility disorders had worse outcomes, required 
      additional surgical interventions, and experienced higher mortality rates, 
      underscoring the importance of both thorough preoperative evaluation and vigilant 
      longitudinal follow-up for this complex patient population.

TI  - Tracheoesophageal Fistula as a Rare Cause of Persistent Pulmonary Tuberculosis 
      Symptoms.
LID - 10.4103/aam.aam_105_25 [doi]
AB  - Tracheoesophageal fistula (TEF) is a rare yet severe complication of tuberculosis 
      (TB), often leading to persistent symptoms, recurrent infections, and treatment 
      failure. Its early recognition and appropriate management are crucial to 
      improving patient outcomes. We report the case of a 24-year-old woman with 
      pulmonary TB who presented with persistent fever, copious expectoration, and 
      progressive weight loss despite receiving anti-tubercular therapy (ATT) for 3 
      months. She developed a right pneumothorax, requiring Malecot catheter insertion, 
      and was referred to our institute due to poor treatment response. Differential 
      diagnoses, including drug-resistant TB and malabsorption, were ruled out. 
      Clinical suspicion of TEF arose due to worsening cough on swallowing. 
      Bronchoscopy confirmed a TEF, five tracheal rings above the carina, measuring 7-8 
      mm in diameter. A computed tomography scan delineated its extent, and 
      bronchoalveolar lavage analysis confirmed Mycobacterium TB. The patient was 
      managed with nasogastric feeding, intravenous antibiotics, and ATT continuation. 
      Her condition improved significantly within 10 days. TEF is a rare but serious 
      complication of pulmonary TB that can significantly impact treatment success. 
      Early recognition, nutritional support, and ATT continuation are crucial for 
      improved outcomes and preventing complications this case underscores the 
      importance of considering TEF in patients with persistent symptoms despite 
      standard TB treatment.

TI  - Early Increase in Weight Is Seen During Treatment for Paediatric Acute 
      Lymphoblastic Leukaemia-A Retrospective Analysis of Medical Records.
LID - 10.1111/apa.70194 [doi]
AB  - AIM: The aim of the study was to assess growth patterns in a national cohort of 
      children aged 0-17.9 years diagnosed with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). 
      METHODS: Medical records at the four tertiary paediatric oncology hospitals in 
      Norway were used for retrospective data collection. Anthropometrics were 
      collected for patients diagnosed between 1 January 2008 and 31 December 2018, 
      weekly, or as soon after as available, and followed up for 10 years after 
      diagnosis. Z-scores were collected from the growth curve function in the medical 
      record software and compared to the Norwegian reference population. Generalised 
      additive mixed model was used for analysis. RESULTS: The analysis included 375 
      paediatric ALL patients. Data displayed an initial weight loss (z-score from 0.00 
      to -0.25) and a stagnation in height growth (z-score from 0.20 to -0.55). 
      Throughout treatment and into remission, weight and body mass index stabilised 
      significantly above the average healthy population (z-score: 0.30 and 0.55 
      respectively). Height was nonsignificantly different in remission compared to the 
      general population (z-score: -0.15). CONCLUSION: Weight gain, and BMI increase, 
      occurred earlier than previously reported. Height was negatively affected by 
      treatment. Monitoring of nutritional status, nutritional support efforts and 
      physical activity is important throughout treatment to prevent unwanted and 
      avoidable fluctuations in growth.

TI  - Sex Hormones Mediate Intensive Lifestyle Intervention-Induced Bone Mineral 
      Density Changes: Look AHEAD Sex Hormone Study.
LID - dgaf359 [pii]
LID - 10.1210/clinem/dgaf359 [doi]
AB  - CONTEXT: The Look AHEAD (Action in Health for Diabetes) randomized controlled 
      trial, which compared an Intensive Lifestyle Intervention (ILI) to the Diabetes 
      Support and Education (DSE) in people with overweight/obesity and type 2 diabetes 
      (T2D), showed a greater decline in bone mineral density (BMD) along with greater 
      weight loss in the ILI group. Because weight loss interventions change sex 
      hormones and also affect BMD, understanding the role of sex hormones on these 
      changes has implications for bone health in people with diabetes. OBJECTIVE: We 
      assessed sex hormone mediation on BMD changes due to ILI, by sex, among 
      postmenopausal females and older men over 4 years of follow-up. METHODS: In the 
      Look AHEAD Sex Hormone Ancillary Study, we applied structural equation models to 
      estimate the effects of ILI (vs. DSE) on hip, femoral neck, and whole-body BMD 
      after 4 years of follow-up, temporally mediated by sex hormones estradiol (E2), 
      total testosterone, bioavailable testosterone, and sex hormone binding globulin 
      (SHBG) measured at one year after baseline (nadir of weight loss). RESULTS: In 
      females, an ILI-associated decrease in estradiol of 14% from baseline to year 1 
      mediated a decline in whole-body BMD (-1.15 mg/cm2, 95%CI: -2.54, -0.21). In 
      males, an ILI-associated increase of 11% in total testosterone mediated a decline 
      of hip BMD (-1.18 mg/cm2, 95%CI: -2.68, -0.13). CONCLUSION: ILI-associated 
      changes in estradiol and total testosterone resulted in whole-body and hip bone 
      loss, providing insights in the potential role of sex hormones in bone loss 
      accompanying weight loss in older adults with T2D who are at a higher risk of 
      bone fractures.

TI  - Digital versus nondigital behavioral interventions on cardiovascular risk 
      reduction: systematic review and meta-analysis.

LID - 10.1093/abm/kaaf043 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: We aimed to assess whether digital behavioral interventions improve 
      cardiovascular risk factors more effectively than nondigital behavioral 
      interventions. METHODS: We searched 7 electronic databases from January 1, 1990, 
      to April 4, 2024. We performed a random-effects meta-analysis to pool the effects 
      of digital versus nondigital interventions on body composition, blood pressure, 
      blood glucose, and lipid concentrations. We also conducted subgroup analyses 
      based on intervention duration, risk of bias, and intervention types. We reported 
      outcomes as mean differences with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs). We 
      assessed the quality of the included studies using the Cochrane Risk of Bias 2 
      tool. RESULTS: We included 34 randomized controlled trials with 17 389 
      participants. The meta-analysis found no significant differences between digital 
      and nondigital behavioral interventions for 11 cardiovascular risk factors. 
      However, subgroup analyses showed that digital dietary interventions 
      significantly reduced body weight (MD = -0.66, 95% CI [-1.26, -0.06]), body mass 
      index-BMI (MD = -0.25, 95% CI [-0.43, -0.07]), and fasting blood glucose 
      (MD = -0.31, 95% CI [-0.57, -0.05]) compared to nondigital interventions. Digital 
      physical activity interventions lowered total cholesterol (MD = -3.55, 95% CI 
      [-4.63, -2.46]) compared to nondigital interventions. Combined digital 
      interventions (dietary, physical activity, and smoking cessation) significantly 
      decreased BMI (MD = -0.20, 95% CI [-0.36, -0.04]) compared to nondigital 
      interventions. No significant differences were found by risk of bias or 
      intervention duration. CONCLUSIONS: Digital behavioral interventions are as 
      effective as nondigital interventions in reducing cardiovascular risk factors, 
      making both essential components of cardiovascular disease prevention and 
      management.

OAB - This study compared digital health interventions, such as mHealth and telehealth, 
      wearable devices, virtual reality, web-based platforms, and social networking 
      apps, with nondigital approaches, including face-to-face programs and printed 
      educational materials, to evaluate the effects of these interventions in reducing 
      heart disease risk factors. We conducted a comprehensive electronic search of 
      peer-reviewed research studies published between January 1, 1990, and April 4, 
      2024. We systematically extracted each study's intervention details. Then, we 
      summarized and compared the effects of digital and nondigital intervention 
      approaches across key heart-health measures, such as weight, blood pressure, 
      blood sugar, and cholesterol. The results showed that digital and nondigital 
      interventions had similar effects on improving cardiovascular disease risk 
      factors. However, in detailed comparisons, digital diet interventions achieved 
      greater weight loss and better blood-sugar control, and digital physical activity 
      interventions lowered cholesterol levels more effectively than nondigital 
      interventions, on average. Moreover, digital interventions that combined diet, 
      exercise, and smoking cessation also showed significant weight reduction. 
      Overall, our study highlights that digital behavioral interventions are as 
      effective as nondigital ones at reducing heart disease risk factors. Both methods 
      offer valuable options for preventing and managing heart disease.

      after 10 years of follow-up].
LID - 10.20960/nh.05876 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: we evaluated the 10-year outcomes of bariatric surgery in a 
      prospective cohort, focusing on weight loss and the evolution of comorbidities. 
      METHODS: this was an observational study involving 96 patients who underwent 
      surgery between 2013 and 2024. We analyzed the percentage of excess weight loss 
      (%EWL) and comorbidity remission. Of the patients, 78.1 % underwent gastric 
      bypass (GB) and 19.8 % vertical sleeve gastrectomy (SG). RESULTS: the %EWL peaked 
      at 57.3 % at 2 years and remained at 43.3 % at 10 years. Preoperative diabetes 
      and hypertension were independent predictors of reduced weight loss. GB showed 
      significant superiority over SG in %EWL at both 5 and 10 years (p < 0.05). 
      Remission rates were high for diabetes, hypertension, dyslipidemia, obstructive 
      sleep apnea (OSA), and hepatic steatosis, with no significant differences between 
      surgical techniques. Mechanical arthropathy did not improve significantly during 
      follow-up (48.9 % vs 50.5 %; p = 0.88). CONCLUSIONS: bariatric surgery maintains 
      clinically relevant weight loss at 10 years, with GB proving superior to SG in 
      the long term. Comorbidities improve significantly, except for arthropathy, which 
      persists despite weight loss.

LID - 10.20960/nh.05886 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: this study analyzed long-term therapeutic failure after bariatric 
      surgery and validated a 10-year predictive risk model. We aimed to integrate 
      clinical and postoperative variables to identify failure-associated factors and 
      establish a clinically useful threshold for follow-up. METHODS: an observational 
      study included 200 patients (78.1 % female, mean age 41.3 years, BMI 44.6 kg/m(2)) 
      undergoing gastric bypass (n = 120) or sleeve gastrectomy (n = 80). Therapeutic 
      failure was defined as < 50 % excess weight loss or comorbidity recurrence. A 
      logistic regression model incorporated baseline BMI, 1-year %EWL, BMI loss, T2DM, 
      and HTN. Validation used ROC curves and Hosmer-Lemeshow testing. RESULTS: failure 
      rates increased from 18 % to 32 % over 10 years. RISK FACTORS: higher baseline 
      BMI (OR = 1.24), T2DM (OR = 3.77), and HTN (OR = 3.83). One-year BMI loss was 
      protective (OR = 0.72). The model showed strong predictive capacity (AU C = 
      0.858), with an optimal threshold of 28.6 % (sensitivity 84.6 %, specificity 80.6 
      %, NPV 93.1 %). Gastric bypass had lower failure rates (28 % vs. 38 %) and better 
      predictive performance (AUC = 0.89 vs. 0.78). CONCLUSIONS: the model effectively 
      predicts long-term failure, with gastric bypass demonstrating superior outcomes. 
      We recommend prioritizing this procedure for patients with higher BMI or 
      comorbidities.

TI  - Digestive disease in individuals living with obesity: beyond weight loss.
LID - 10.17235/reed.2025.11375/2025 [doi]
AB  - Obesity is a chronic, progressive, and systemic disease that profoundly reshapes 
      the landscape of digestive health. Beyond excess adiposity, it constitutes a 
      multifactorial condition driven by complex interactions among genetic, metabolic, 
      microbiological, and social determinants. This narrative review delineates the 
      extensive and heterogeneous impact of obesity across the digestive tract, with a 
      particular emphasis on metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease, 
      now the most prevalent chronic liver condition globally and a leading indication 
      for liver transplantation. Obesity also modulates the pathophysiology, severity, 
      and prognosis of functional gastrointestinal disorders, biliopancreatic diseases, 
      inflammatory bowel disease, and digestive cancers, through mechanisms involving 
      visceral adiposity, low-grade systemic inflammation, gut-brain axis disruption, 
      and intestinal dysbiosis. The review highlights the emerging role of endoscopic 
      bariatric therapies -especially endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty- as minimally 
      invasive interventions that modulate enteroendocrine signaling, improve liver 
      histology, and achieve sustained metabolic benefits. Beyond the clinical realm, 
      the article addresses the ethical imperative of destigmatizing obesity, the 
      impact of food insecurity and health inequities on digestive outcomes, and the 
      critical need for a multidisciplinary, patient-centered, and precision-based 
      approach to digestive care. Gastroenterologists are called to transcend 
      traditional boundaries, assuming leadership in prevention, early detection, and 
      integrated management of obesity and its digestive sequelae. In doing so, 
      digestive medicine becomes not only a responder to the consequences of obesity, 
      but an active agent in transforming one of the most urgent public health 
      challenges of the 21st century.

AB  - Whipple's disease is a rare systemic infection caused by Tropheryma whipplei, 
      characterized by nonspecific gastrointestinal symptoms, joint pain, and weight 
      loss. We report a case initially misdiagnosed as sarcoidosis, where imaging (CT 
      and endoscopy) and histological analysis (PAS-positive duodenal macrophages) 
      provided essential clues for diagnosis, highlighting the importance of radiologic 
      findings in differentiating Whipple's disease from other granulomatous 
      conditions.

AB  - CASE SUMMARY: An 8-year-old castrated male mixed-breed cat was presented with 
      recurrent vomiting, weight loss and abdominal distension. Blood work revealed 
      hyperbilirubinaemia and elevated liver enzyme activities. Abdominal ultrasound 
      and CT showed marked dilation and obstruction of the common bile duct (CBD) due 
      to chronic cholecystitis and cholangiohepatitis. The cat was diagnosed with CBD 
      obstruction secondary to chronic cholecystitis and cholangiohepatitis and was 
      initially treated with antibiotics and prednisolone. Surgical intervention was 
      performed because of complete CBD obstruction and worsening icterus that was 
      unresponsive to medical management. A choledochoduodenostomy was performed using 
      a simple side-to-side anastomosis between the CBD and the duodenum. The patient 
      recovered uneventfully after surgery without significant complications. At the 
      last follow-up, 6 months postoperatively, the cat remained clinically stable. 
      RELEVANCE AND NOVEL INFORMATION: There is limited information on 
      choledochoduodenostomy in cats. This is the first veterinary report describing a 
      simple side-to-side anastomosis between the CBD and the duodenum to resolve 
      severe extrahepatic biliary obstruction secondary to chronic cholangitis and 
      cholecystitis. As a result of the dilation and thickening of the CBD wall, this 
      technique was feasible. This case study lacks information on long-term prognosis 
      and continued monitoring is important.

LID - 108412
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic diarrhoea in people living with human immunodeficiency virus 
      (PLHIV)/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome presents a diagnostic challenge, often 
      resulting from opportunistic infections (OIs), malignancies, or disease 
      progression itself. We present a case of an advanced human immunodeficiency virus 
      (HIV) patient with chronic diarrhoea, significant weight loss, and antiretroviral 
      therapy (ART) non-compliance, highlighting the diagnostic dilemma between HIV 
      wasting syndrome, OIs, and malignancy. CASE SUMMARY: A 36-year-old female, 
      diagnosed with HIV five years ago on family screening, presented with three 
      months of profuse watery diarrhoea, associated with crampy abdominal pain and 
      weight loss (14 kg, 30% in 3 months). She was non-compliant with ART. There was 
      no history of recent travel, food contamination, or tuberculosis contact. Fever 
      episodes were mild and transient. Physical examination revealed pallor and 
      bilateral pedal oedema without lymphadenopathy or organomegaly. Genital 
      examination was unremarkable. Routine investigations revealed severe anaemia and 
      confirmed PLHIV status. CD4 count was < 36 cells/microL. Empirical treatment with 
      nitazoxanide was initiated for possible cryptosporidiosis. After ruling out OIs, 
      ART was restarted. With treatment, her diarrhoea resolved, and she tolerated oral 
      intake. Nutritional support was provided, and she was discharged in stable 
      condition with ART, prophylactic antibiotics, and follow-up instructions for 
      further evaluation. CONCLUSION: In ART-noncompliant PLHIV with chronic diarrhoea, 
      distinguishing between HIV wasting syndrome, OIs (Cryptosporidium, Mycobacterium 
      avium complex, cytomegalovirus colitis) and malignancies (non-Hodgkin lymphoma 
      and anal carcinoma) are critical. Gradual CD4 decline, systemic inflammation, and 
      malnutrition favour progressive HIV/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome rather 
      than an acute OI or malignancy. Early recognition and management, including ART 
      reinitiation and nutritional support, are crucial for prognosis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Laparoscopic sleeve gastrectomy is the most common bariatric surgical 
      and a life changing surgery which used for helping patients who are suffering 
      from obesity for losing weight and enhance their health weight loss. MATERIALS 
      AND METHODS: A descriptive, cross sectional study design was conducted in Holy 
      Karbala from 1 December 2023 until 2 February 2024 in Surgical Unit at Al-imam 
      Hussein Medical City, 25 nurses working in surgical unit was selected purposively 
      according to inclusion and exclusion criteria. The data was collected through the 
      use of constructive questions as a structured interviewer. The data was 
      investigated with statistical processes and using the SPSS version 25 application 
      statistical analysis coordination. RESULTS: Showed that the majority of studied 
      sample were single female nurse at the age group ranging between (21 and 27) 
      years old at the Mean = 27.12, standard deviation = +5.375, and about 88% from 
      them lived in urban area and 48% of studied sampled graduated from Faculty of 
      Nursing. CONCLUSION: Nurses' knowledge about sleeve gastrostomy was ranging 
      between poor to moderate, and as general the total score of nurses' knowledges 
      was poor in all domains. There was no significant association between nurses' 
      knowledge and their demographic data. The study recommended enhancing nurses' 
      opportunity in the surgical ward to provide updating their education to demand 
      knowledge and skills regarding sleeve gastrectomy.

AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: The rising prevalence of obesity in Saudi Arabia is alarming, 
      with studies indicating that over 35% of the adult population is classified as 
      obese. This study determines the prevalence and associated risk factors 
      associated with weight loss medicine usage in the Hail papulation, Saudi Arabia. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This is a cross-sectional study, which was conducted in 
      King Salman Hospital, Hail. A total of 463 participants were recruited in the 
      study through simple random sampling. A validated and structured questionnaire 
      was used. Logistic regression analysis was used to identify factors associated 
      with weight loss medicine usage and awareness. P value < 0.05 was considered 
      statistically significant. RESULTS: The prevalence of anti-obesity drug use was 
      29.2%, with higher use found among never smokers (82.2%) and those with a body 
      mass index (BMI) of 24.9-29.9 kg/m(2) (69.6%). Most anti-obesity drugs used were 
      sold over the counter (46.71%) or prescribed by doctors (35.1%). The factors 
      significantly associated with anti-obesity drug use included being in the 31-60 
      age group (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] 1.87, P value 0.004), having primary 
      education (AOR 2.90, P value 0.045), and having no past medical or surgical 
      history (AOR 2.76, P value 0.000). Among all participants, 54% were believed that 
      affordability is important to used anti-obesity. CONCLUSION: The study highlights 
      a relatively high prevalence of anti-obesity drug use, particularly among 
      individuals with a BMI in the overweight range. Socio-demographic factors such as 
      age, education, and health history influence the use of these medications. 
      Interventions targeting affordability and promoting natural weight management 
      methods may be important in addressing obesity treatment approaches.

      and Muscle Mass Indices.
PG  - e70077
LID - 10.1002/osp4.70077 [doi]
LID - e70077
AB  - BACKGROUND: BMI has limitations in assessing metabolic health, especially in 
      diverse populations. Fat mass index (FMI) and skeletal muscle mass (SMM) are more 
      accurate predictors of obesity-related risks. Redefining obesity as a fat 
      accumulation disease highlights the need for body composition-focused assessments 
      in clinical practice. OBJECTIVES: This study assessed body composition changes in 
      a Latino population over 6 months, evaluating the utility of fat mass index (FMI) 
      and skeletal muscle mass (SMM) in detecting significant variations and exploring 
      associations with baseline characteristics. METHODS: In this retrospective 
      observational study, 1571 Latino patients were categorized into hypocaloric-high 
      protein (HHP) and eucaloric-high protein (EHP) groups based on baseline BMI. Body 
      composition was measured using bioelectrical impedance analysis at baseline and 
      after 6 months. Chi-square tests evaluated categorical shifts in classifications, 
      while multinomial logistic and linear regression models identified factors 
      associated with fat and muscle mass changes, adjusting for sex, age, and baseline 
      composition metrics. RESULTS: Over 6 months, participants experienced significant 
      reductions in body fat mass (31.24-27.25 kg, p < 0.001) and increases in skeletal 
      muscle mass (24.31-25.85 kg, p < 0.001). In the HHP group, baseline FMI and age 
      were significantly associated with fat mass changes, with younger individuals and 
      those with lower baseline FMI being more prone to fat accumulation (p < 0.001). 
      In both groups, higher baseline SMM was associated with greater likelihood of 
      muscle loss and lower probability of muscle gain, suggesting a physiological 
      ceiling effect (p < 0.001). CONCLUSIONS: FMI and SMM enhance clinical assessments 
      by providing more individualized metrics for obesity management in Latino 
      populations. These findings support the integration of body composition analysis 
      into clinical practice for more precise evaluation of metabolic health beyond 
      traditional BMI classifications.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Pancreatic tuberculosis (PTB) is a rare disease, even in 
      immunocompetent hosts. Abdominal tuberculosis involving the pancreatic head and 
      peripancreatic areas may simulate pancreatic head carcinoma. CASE SUMMARY: We 
      present the case of a 32-year-old man who was admitted to our hospital for 
      intermittent epigastric pain and weight loss. A computed tomography scan and 
      magnetic resonance imaging revealed a mass in the head of the pancreas. The 
      lesion was initially diagnosed as pancreatic head carcinoma on abdominal imaging. 
      Laparotomy confirmed the diagnosis of PTB and the patient received 
      antituberculosis therapy. CONCLUSION: The present case is reported to emphasize 
      the importance of including PTB in the differential diagnosis of pancreatic 
      lesions.

TI  - Review of porcine circovirus 3-associated lesions in swine: Challenges and 
      advances in diagnostics.
PG  - 3009858251347522
LID - 10.1177/03009858251347522 [doi]
AB  - Porcine circovirus 3 (PCV3) is a recently identified pathogen in swine 
      populations. It is considered a ubiquitous virus and is frequently associated 
      with subclinical infections throughout various stages of production. PCV3 is 
      detectable in diverse tissues, blood, and secretions, indicating systemic 
      dissemination and potential for both vertical and horizontal transmission. PCV3 
      has been implicated in reproductive and postnatal diseases collectively named as 
      PCV3-associated diseases (PCV3-AD). Clinically, PCV3-AD encompasses reproductive 
      disorders such as mummified fetuses, stillbirths, and weak neonates, alongside 
      postnatal manifestations including anorexia, weight loss, and progressive 
      wasting. Histopathologically, PCV3-AD is primarily defined by systemic 
      nonsuppurative periarteritis and arteritis that are observed across multiple 
      tissues, particularly within the heart, mesenteric arterial plexus, and kidneys. 
      Despite the broad tissue tropism and frequent detection of viral nucleic acids 
      within affected vascular and parenchymal structures, the precise mechanisms 
      underpinning PCV3 pathogenesis remain poorly understood. Diagnosis of PCV3-AD 
      relies on the confluence of characteristic clinical signs, compatible 
      histopathological findings, and the in situ detection of the virus within 
      lesions. However, the true prevalence of PCV3-AD under field conditions is likely 
      underestimated due to the limited availability and high costs associated with 
      laboratory techniques for definitive viral detection. This review seeks to 
      consolidate and interpret clinical and pathological evidence indicative of 
      PCV3-AD while addressing the critical diagnostic challenges faced by veterinary 
      pathologists. Enhanced understanding of the disease's clinical-pathological 
      correlations and diagnostic approaches is essential to accurately assess its 
      impact on swine health and production.

AB  - This research focused on the development of an edible coat made of corn waste 
      arabinoxylan enriched with nanohybrids of zinc layered hydroxide salt and thymol 
      (ZnHSL, ZnHSL-T). The crystallographic phase was confirmed with XRD (ICDD card 
      07-0155) and SEM. Filmogenic solutions prepared with the polysaccharide (AX) 
      containing thymol (T), ZnHSL, and ZnHSL-T (AXT, AXH, and AXHT, respectively) were 
      characterized by FTIR spectroscopy, color, thickness, transparency, and moisture 
      content, where AXHT exhibited the thinnest layer. Furthermore, the antioxidant 
      activity of the coatings was evaluated by the inhibition of ABTS radical, proving 
      that thymol was present in the filmogenic solutions with inhibitions of 90%. 
      Also, edible coatings were applied on cherry tomatoes (Solanum lycopersicum var. 
      cerasiforme) and stored for 12 days, a period during which physicochemical 
      properties (weight loss, color, lycopene content, soluble solids, pH, and 
      titratable acidity) and Salmonella survival (serovar Enteritidis, Typhimurium, 
      and Montevideo) were evaluated. Results demonstrated that AXHT had less weight 
      loss than the control, and the other physicochemical properties of tomatoes were 
      preserved. Regarding pathogen adherence, AXHT reduced the bacterial survival for 
      Salmonella Enteritidis, S. Typhimurium, and S. Montevideo in 25, 30, and 45%, 
      respectively, by day 12. The findings of this research demonstrate the 
      application of nanotechnology to biopolymers, enabling the production of safer 
      foods with acceptable quality parameters for consumers.

AB  - Background/Objectives: Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 
      (SARS-CoV-2), the causative agent of Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19), has 
      rapidly evolved, giving rise to multiple Variants of Concern-including Alpha, 
      Beta, Gamma, Delta, and Omicron-which emerged independently across different 
      regions. Licensed COVID-19 vaccines primarily target the highly mutable spike 
      protein, resulting in reduced efficacy due to immune escape by emerging variants. 
      Previously, we developed a live attenuated Francisella tularensis LVS DeltacapB 
      single-vector platform COVID-19 vaccine, rLVS DeltacapB/MN, expressing the conserved 
      membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N) proteins from the early SARS-CoV-2 WA-01/2020 
      strain. In this study, we evaluate the efficacy of rLVS DeltacapB/MN and an enhanced 
      version, rLVS DeltacapB::RdRp/MN, which additionally expresses the conserved 
      RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) protein from the same strain, in a hamster 
      model. Methods: Both vaccine candidates were administered orally or intranasally 
      to golden Syrian hamsters (equal numbers of males and females) and evaluated 
      against intranasal challenge with SARS-CoV-2 Delta (B.1.617.2-AY.1) and Omicron 
      (BA.5) variants. Results: Vaccinated animals developed robust, TH1-biased IgG 
      responses specific to the nucleocapsid protein. Following SARS-CoV-2 challenge, 
      immunized hamsters exhibited reduced weight loss, lower oropharyngeal and lung 
      viral titers, and improved lung pathology scores compared with unvaccinated 
      controls. Conclusion: These findings support the potential of this universal 
      vaccine to provide broad protection against current and future SARS-CoV-2 
      variants, with minimal need for updating.

TI  - Intranasal Administration of Cold-Adapted Live-Attenuated Eurasian Avian-like 
      H1N1 Vaccine Candidate Confers Protection Against Different-Lineage H1N1 Viruses 
      in Mice.
LID - 596 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/vaccines13060596 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/OBJECTIVES: Eurasian avian-like (EA) H1N1 swine influenza viruses, 
      with their persistent evolution and zoonotic potential, seriously threaten both 
      swine and human health. The objective was to develop an effective vaccine against 
      these viruses. METHODS: A cold-adapted, temperature-sensitive live-attenuated 
      influenza vaccine (LAIV) candidate, GX18ca, was developed. It was derived from 
      the wild-type EA H1N1 strain A/swine/Guangxi/18/2011 (GX18) through serial 
      passaging in embryonated eggs at temperatures decreasing from 33  degrees C to 25  degrees C. Its 
      characteristics were studied in mice, including attenuation, immune responses 
      (mucosal IgA, serum IgG, IFN-gamma+ CD4(+)/CD8(+) T-cell responses), and protective 
      efficacy against homologous (GX18), heterologous EA H1N1 (LN972), and human 
      2009/H1N1 (SC1) viruses. RESULTS: GX18ca showed cold-adapted and 
      temperature-sensitive phenotypes. In mice, it was attenuated, with viral titers 
      in the nasal turbinates and lungs reduced 1000-10,000-fold compared to the 
      wild-type strain, and it cleared by day 5 post infection. Intranasal immunization 
      elicited strong cross-reactive immune responses. Mucosal IgA had broad 
      reactivity, and serum IgG titers reached high levels. IFN-gamma+ CD4(+/)CD8(+) T-cell 
      responses were detected against all the tested viruses. A single dose of GX18ca 
      fully protected against GX18 and LN972 challenges, and two doses significantly 
      reduced SC1 lung viral loads, preventing mortality and weight loss. CONCLUSIONS: 
      GX18ca is a promising LAIV candidate. It can induce broad immunity, addressing 
      the cross-protection gaps against evolving EA H1N1 SIVs and zoonotic H1N1 
      variants, which is crucial for swine influenza control and pandemic preparedness.

TI  - Potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) Cultivars Interact with Wound Healing Period to 
      Modulate Sprout Emergence, Crop Stand, and Productivity.
LID - 1830 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/plants14121830 [doi]
AB  - The effects of wound healing on crop stand and productivity were examined on the 
      potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) cultivars Alturas (Alt), Russet Burbank (RB), and 
      Clearwater Russet (CW). Tuber yields increased linearly with an advancing wound 
      healing period irrespective of the cultivar (R(2) = 0.91). In contrast to 
      unhealed controls, RB and CW wound-healed for 8 days produced a 6% and 8% greater 
      yield, respectively, while a shorter wound healing period of 2 days increased Alt 
      yield by 7%. Increases in tuber yield, a consequence of enhanced specific tuber 
      weight across wound healing periods, contributed towards increased relative crop 
      value in Alt (13%), RB (22%), and CW (19%). In further lab evaluations, Alt 
      exhibited increased desiccation resistance and was associated with an earlier 
      induction (24 h post-wounding) of feruloyl transferase (FHT) compared to CW and 
      RB. Since FHT facilitates suberin and wax development, delayed FHT induction 
      likely promoted fresh-weight loss in CW and RB compared to Alt. Enzymatic 
      evaluations to assess the production of reactive oxygen species to protect 
      fresh-cut seed found that RB had the highest activities of superoxide dismutase 
      and peroxidase. This study demonstrates the broad benefits of planting 
      wound-healed seed while highlighting opportunities to improve best practices and 
      genetic improvement for wound healing response.

TI  - SARS-CoV-2 (MA10) Infection Aggravates Cerebrovascular Pathology in Endothelial 
      Nitric Oxide Synthase-Deficient Mice.
LID - 784 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/v17060784 [doi]
AB  - SARS-CoV-2 can cause neurological issues, including cognitive dysfunction in 
      COVID-19 survivors. Endothelial dysfunction, a key mechanism in COVID-19, is also 
      a risk factor for vascular dementia (VaD). Reduced nitric oxide (NO) 
      bioavailability is a pathogenic factor of endothelial dysfunction and platelet 
      aggregation in COVID-19 patients, and endothelial NO synthase (eNOS) levels 
      decline with advancing age, a risk factor for both COVID-19 morbidity and VaD. 
      SARS-CoV-2 also induces cellular senescence and senescence-associated secretory 
      phenotype (SASP). We hypothesized that eNOS deficiency would worsen 
      neuroinflammation, senescence, blood-brain barrier (BBB) permeability, and 
      hypercoagulability in eNOS-deficient mice. Six-month-old eNOS(+/-) 
      (pre-cognitively impaired experimental VaD) and wild-type (WT) male mice were 
      infected with mouse-adapted (MA10) SARS-CoV-2. Mice were evaluated for weight 
      loss, viral load, and markers of inflammation and senescence 3 days 
      post-infection. eNOS(+/-) mice showed more weight loss (~15%) compared to WT mice 
      (~5%) and increased inflammatory markers (Ccl2, Cxcl9, Cxcl10, IL-1beta, and IL-6) 
      and senescence markers (p53 and p21). They also exhibited higher microglial 
      activation (Iba1) and increased plasma coagulation and BBB permeability, despite 
      comparable lung viral loads and absence of virus in the brain. This is the first 
      experimental evidence demonstrating that eNOS deficiency exacerbates 
      SARS-CoV-2-induced morbidity, neuroinflammation, and brain senescence, linking 
      eNOS to COVID-19-related neuropathology.

TI  - Combined Phytochemical Sulforaphane and Dietary Fiber Inulin Contribute to the 
      Prevention of ER-Negative Breast Cancer via PI3K/AKT/MTOR Pathway and Modulating 
      Gut Microbial Composition.
LID - 2023 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17122023 [doi]
AB  - Background: Breast cancer (BC) is the second most common cancer among women in 
      the United States. It has been estimated that one in eight women will be 
      diagnosed with breast cancer in her lifetime. Various BC risk factors, such as 
      age, physical inactivity, and smoking, play a substantial role in BC occurrence 
      and development. Early life dietary intervention with plant-based bioactive 
      compounds has been studied for its potential role in BC prevention. Sulforaphane 
      (SFN), an isothiocyanate, is an antioxidant and anti-inflammatory agent extracted 
      from broccoli sprouts (BSp) and other plants. Dietary supplementation of SFN 
      suppresses tumor growth by inducing protective epigenetic changes and inhibiting 
      cancer cell proliferation. Inulin, as a dietary fiber, has been studied for 
      alleviating GI discomfort and weight loss by promoting the growth of beneficial 
      bacteria in the gut. Objective: Early-life combinatorial treatment with both 
      phytochemical SFN and potential prebiotic agent inulin at lower and safer dosages 
      may confer more efficacious and beneficial effects in BC prevention. Methods: 
      Transgenic mice representing estrogen receptor-negative BC were fed 26% (w/w) BSp 
      and 2% (w/v) inulin supplemented in food and water, respectively. Results: The 
      combinatorial treatment inhibited tumor growth, increased tumor onset latency, 
      and synergistically reduced tumor weight. Gut microbial composition was analyzed 
      between groups, where Ruminococcus, Muribaculaceae, and Faecalibaculum 
      significantly increased, while Blautia, Turicibacter, and Clostridium sensu 
      stricto 1 significantly decreased in the combinatorial group compared with the 
      control group. Furthermore, combinatorial treatment induced a protective 
      epigenetic effect by inhibiting histone deacetylases (HDACs) and DNA 
      methyltransferases (DNMTs). Intermediates in the AKT/PI3K/MTOR pathway were 
      significantly suppressed by the combinatorial treatment, including PI3K p85, 
      p-AKT, p-PI3K p55, MTOR, and NF-kappaB. Cell cycle arrest and programmed cell death 
      were induced by the combinatorial treatment via elevating the expression of 
      cleaved-caspase 3 and 7 and inhibiting the expressions of CDK2 and CDK4, 
      respectively. Orally administering F. rodentium attenuated tumor growth and 
      induced apoptosis in a syngeneic triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) mouse 
      model. Conclusions: Overall, the findings suggest that early-life dietary 
      combinatorial treatment contributed to BC prevention and may be a potential 
      epigenetic therapy that serves as an adjunct to other traditional neoadjuvant 
      therapies.

TI  - Exploring Strategies to Promote Exercise as a Viable Obesity and Chronic Disease 
      Treatment.
LID - 1997 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/nu17121997 [doi]
AB  - Obesity and its related comorbidities continue to be a primary public health 
      concern, especially in the United States (US). Such comorbidities include the top 
      two causes of death in the US: cardiovascular disease and cancer. Obesity is also 
      associated with several other chronic conditions that affect millions of adults 
      and children, including diabetes, kidney, and liver disease. Weight loss has long 
      been considered the front-line treatment and prevention strategy for these 
      conditions. Lifestyle approaches, including dietary modification and increasing 
      physical activity, are typically recommended for individuals with obesity, 
      although rates of achieving and maintaining clinically meaningful weight loss 
      remain low. Understanding the root causes of minimal weight loss and weight 
      regain has been a prime focus among many researchers over the past several 
      decades. The present review addresses several advantages of prioritizing exercise 
      as an obesity and chronic disease treatment. We discuss current challenges when 
      exercise is the primary treatment strategy, including physiological parameters 
      that may influence the efficacy of exercise in addition to behavioral and 
      environmental factors that play a role in exercise adherence and adoption. We 
      also explore strategies and principles that, although not commonly utilized in an 
      obesity/chronic disease treatment setting, may be applied and adapted to fit this 
      model.

TI  - Towards a Sustainable Material Protection: Olanzapine Drugs and Their Derivatives 
      as Corrosion Inhibitors for C1018 Steel in 1 M Hydrochloric Acid.
LID - 10.3390/ma18122902 [doi]
LID - 2902
AB  - This study investigates the synthesis process and characterization methods and 
      evaluates the inhibition behavior of olanzapine 
      (2-methyl-4-(4-methyl-1-piperazinyl)-10H-thieno-[2,3-b] 1,5]benzodiazepine (OLZ)) 
      and its derivatives, such as 
      3-(2-methyl-4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-10H-benzo[b]thieno[2,3-e] 
      [1,4]diazepin-10-yl) propenamide (OLZ1) and Ethyl 
      2-(2-methyl-4-(4-methylpiperazin-1-yl)-10H-benzo[b]thieno[2,3-e][1,4]diazepin-10 
      yl) acetate (OLZ2) for carbon steel (C1018) in a 1 M HCl acidic solution. Fourier 
      Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) and Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) were 
      employed to verify their molecular structures and functional groups, which 
      characterized the derivatives after synthesis. Their corrosion inhibition 
      potential for C1018 steel in acidic media was estimated by weight loss (WL) and 
      electrochemical techniques, such as electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), 
      linear polarization resistance (LPR), and potentiodynamic polarization (PDP), 
      accompanied by surface analysis methods. The findings revealed that all three 
      derivatives demonstrated exceptional inhibition performance, achieving maximum 
      efficiencies of 88.83%, 91.20%, and 91.82% for OLZ, OLZ1, and OLZ2 at 300 ppm, 
      respectively. Weight loss experiments across different temperatures further 
      explored their inhibitory behavior. Although inhibition efficiency decreased with 
      a temperature increase to 318 K, the derivatives still displayed notable 
      performance, with maximum efficiencies of 74.75% for OLZ, 81.63% for OLZ1, and 
      79.44% for OLZ2. Polarization studies identified the corrosion inhibition 
      mechanisms as an anodic type. Surface characterization of the C1018 steel 
      coupons, both with and without the inhibitors, was performed using FTIR and 
      scanning electron microscopy (SEM) combined with energy-dispersive X-ray 
      spectroscopy (EDX). These analyses indicated the creation of a protective 
      inhibitor layer on the carbon steel surface, reducing corrosion in the acidic 
      environment. Overall, this study underscores the potential of these drug 
      derivatives as corrosion inhibitors, combining structural insights and 
      performance assessments to support their industrial application.

TI  - Mediterranean Basin Erica Species: Traditional Uses, Phytochemistry and 
      Pharmacological Properties.
LID - 10.3390/molecules30122616 [doi]
LID - 2616
AB  - Erica species native to the Mediterranean basin are the principal Ericas that 
      have found use in traditional medicine. Examples include treatments for urinary 
      tract disorders, inflammatory conditions, gastrointestinal ailments and weight 
      loss. This review critically evaluates the ethnobotanical usage, phytochemical 
      profiles and pharmacological potential of the Mediterranean Erica species, 
      including Erica arborea L., Erica multiflora L. and Erica manipuliflora Salisb. A 
      wide spectrum of bioactive secondary metabolites has been identified across these 
      species, notably pentacyclic triterpenes (e.g., lupeol, ursolic acid and 
      oleanolic acid) and polyphenolics (e.g., myricetin and quercetin glycosides). 
      Extracts of these species have demonstrated antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, 
      analgesic, antimicrobial and diuretic activities in vitro and/or in vivo, 
      providing pharmacological support for traditional uses. Phytochemical profiles 
      vary by species, plant part, geography and extraction technique. Filsuvez((R)), 
      comprising pentacyclic triterpenes from birch bark, has clinical approval for the 
      treatment of partial thickness wounds associated with dystrophic and junctional 
      epidermolysis bullosa. The undoubted reservoir of pentacyclic triterpenes and 
      flavonoid glycosides in Mediterranean Erica species warrants further 
      comprehensive mechanistic studies, toxicological evaluations and clinical 
      validation.

TI  - The Impact of TRIM67 Knockout on Early Intestinal Antimicrobial Capacity in Mice 
      Infected with Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium ATCC 14028.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061267 [doi]
LID - 1267
AB  - Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) is an intracellular 
      pathogen that survives and replicates within host cells. Macrophages, key immune 
      cells in infection defense, play a vital role in pathogen clearance through 
      polarization (M1/M2) and NLRP3 inflammasome activation. While TRIM67 regulates 
      macrophage recruitment in the liver, its role in S. Typhimurium infection remains 
      unclear. In this study, a S. Typhimurium infection model was established by 
      orally infecting streptomycin-pretreated TRIM67 WT and KO mice with 1 x 10(9) CFU 
      of S. Typhimurium. TRIM67 expression in the ileum, colon, mesenteric lymph nodes 
      (MLNs), and peritoneal macrophages (PMs) was assessed via qRT-PCR and Western 
      blotting. Histopathological changes were analyzed using HE and PAS staining. IHC 
      staining, flow cytometry (FCM), qRT-PCR, and Western blotting were used to 
      evaluate TRIM67 knockout effects on macrophage recruitment, polarization, and 
      NLRP3 inflammasome activation. In vitro, PMs were infected with S. Typhimurium 
      (MOI 1:20), and TRIM67's role in macrophage polarization and NLRP3 activation was 
      validated. S. Typhimurium infection significantly upregulated TRIM67 in the 
      ileum, colon, and MLN. TRIM67 knockout reduced intestinal inflammatory cell 
      infiltration but worsened goblet cell loss and impaired digestion. Bacterial load 
      assays revealed weakened pathogen clearance, leading to weight loss and increased 
      mortality. TRIM67 knockout inhibited intestinal macrophage recruitment, M1 
      polarization in MLN, and NLRP3 activation. In vitro, TRIM67 knockout increased 
      PMs' intracellular bacterial load and suppressed NLRP3, caspase-1, and IL-1beta 
      expression. TRIM67 knockout impairs the host's ability to clear S. Typhimurium by 
      inhibiting M1 macrophage polarization and NLRP3 inflammasome activation.

TI  - Alleviation of Adipose Tissue Inflammation and Obesity Suppression by a Probiotic 
      Strain That Induces GLP-1 Secretion.

AB  - Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) is a hormone secreted from enteroendocrine cells 
      that can promote weight loss and blood glucose improvement. We screened probiotic 
      strains that effectively stimulate GLP-1 secretion from human enteroendocrine 
      cells and then investigated the efficacy of this strain in a high-fat diet 
      (HFD)-induced mouse model of obesity. Lactiplantibacillus plantarum GB104 greatly 
      induced GLP-1 secretion by increasing expression of the proglucagon gene (GCG), 
      but not the proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 1 gene (PCSK1) in the 
      human enteroendocrine cell line NCI-H716. In an HFD-induced mouse model of 
      obesity, GB104 inhibited weight gain and improved blood glucose levels by 
      increasing blood GLP-1 levels. It also tended to attenuate the HFD-induced 
      changes in blood levels of other hormones and suppressed fat accumulation in the 
      liver and adipose tissues. In white adipose tissue, GB104 suppressed inflammation 
      by reducing pro-inflammatory M1 macrophages and increasing anti-inflammatory M2 
      macrophages and regulatory T cells. Probiotic strains that promote GLP-1 
      secretion, such as GB104, may serve as a promising candidate for dietary 
      intervention against obesity and metabolic diseases.

TI  - Paraesophageal hernia repair combined with Roux-en-Y gastric bypass reduces 
      short-term hernia recurrence with added metabolic benefit in patients with 
      BMI >/= 35: A 15-year experience.
LID - 10.1007/s00464-025-11950-8 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Obesity is a risk factor for paraesophageal hernias (PEH), with 
      reported higher prevalence in patients with obesity. Similarly, higher body mass 
      index (BMI) levels adversely affect PEH repair outcomes, with well-documented 
      hernia recurrence rates in patients with obesity. We sought to investigate PEH 
      recurrence in combined laparoscopic PEH repair with laparoscopic Roux-en-Y 
      gastric bypass (LPEHr/LRYGB) vs laparoscopic PEH repair alone (LPEHr) in patients 
      with obesity. We hypothesized that LPEHr/LRYGB is associated with reduced PEH 
      recurrence and improved metabolic outcomes compared to LPEHr. METHODS: A 
      retrospective review of a prospectively maintained database from a single 
      academic institution was conducted. We included patients with BMI >/= 35, with type 
      II, III, and IV large PEH (defined as >/= 35% of intrathoracic stomach) operated 
      from 1/1/2009 to 1/1/2024. Patients with previous foregut surgery or concomitant 
      weight loss surgery other than LRYGB were excluded. The primary outcome was 
      overall PEH recurrence. Secondary outcomes were defined by metabolic benefit, 
      measured by reduction in BMI between the two groups, and acid reflux symptoms at 
      time of recurrence, measured by proton pump inhibitor (PPI) use. Additionally, we 
      looked at procedural variability in the surgeries. Statistical analysis was 
      performed by comparing propensity-matched groups using Kaplan-Meier estimates and 
      a Log-rank test. RESULTS: A total of 397 patients underwent index LPEHr/LRYGB 
      (n = 223) or LPEHr (n = 174). After propensity matching, there were a total of 
      180 patients with 90 patients in each group. Median follow-up after propensity 
      matching for LPEHr/LRYGB was 57 months vs 53 months for LPEHr. There was a 
      significant reduction of PEH recurrence rate for the first 36 months of follow-up 
      in patients who underwent LPEHr/LRYGB compared to LPEHr (p = 0.015); however, the 
      recurrence rates converged subsequently and at 72 months of follow-up, the 
      difference was no longer significant (p = 0.6). Time until reoperation between 
      the groups was not significantly different (p = 0.447). Patients who underwent 
      LPEHr/LRYGB had a significant reduction in BMI compared to LPEHr at follow-up 
      (- 10.2 kg/m2 vs - 2.2 kg/m2; p < 0.001). Use of PPI at time of PEH recurrence 
      was not significantly different between the groups (p = 0.065). While use of mesh 
      was significantly higher in the LPEHr group (59% vs 7%; p < 0.001), use of mesh 
      was not associated with lower PEH recurrence (p = 0.273). CONCLUSION: Patients 
      with obesity with a BMI >/= 35 who underwent LPEHr/LRYGB had a significant 
      reduction in early PEH recurrence rate for the first 36 months compared to LPEHr, 
      in addition to significant added metabolic benefit measured by long-term 
      reduction in BMI. The long-term PEH recurrence rate between these groups showed 
      no difference at 72 months of follow-up and beyond.

TI  - Higher BMI increases risk of stoma-site incisional hernia and other complications 
      following diverting loop ileostomy and reversal: a systematic review and 
      meta-analysis.
LID - 10.1007/s00464-025-11887-y [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Diverting loop ileostomies (DLI) are commonly used to protect 
      high-risk anastomoses. While a higher body mass index (BMI) is known to increase 
      postoperative morbidity, its specific effect on DLI-related complications is less 
      well understood. METHODS: This systematic review and meta-analysis followed 
      PRISMA guidelines, and Cochrane Library, Embase, PubMed, and Google Scholar were 
      searched for English publications without time restrictions. Statistical analysis 
      was performed using Meta-Mar v3.5.1. RESULTS: Out of 586 studies yielded and 6 
      manually retrieved, 26 were included, totaling 5,141 patients (53.5% male). The 
      mean ages were 35.0-65.3 years, and the mean BMI was 19.8-27.1 kg/m(2). Higher 
      BMI increased stoma-site incisional hernia in 100% (n = 7) with a standardized 
      mean difference of 0.88 (95% CI, 0.34-1.42). Two studies (40%) reported increased 
      peristomal skin complications. One study each (100%) found increased risk for 
      delayed reversal, stoma outlet obstruction, stoma-specific morbidity score, and 
      longer operative time. Elevated BMI increased anastomotic leakage in 2 studies 
      (50%), surgical site infection in 1 (33%), permanent stoma in 1 (20%), and 
      overall complications in 2 (67%). However, no significant BMI differences were 
      seen for high-output ileostomies, stoma retraction, parastomal hernia, 
      complications after reversal, length of hospital stay, or mortality. BMI > 30 was 
      associated with higher complication risks overall (OR [95% CI], 2.01 
      [1.11-3.64]), but BMI > 25 showed no significant difference except for stoma-site 
      incisional hernia (OR [95% CI], 4.66 [3.54-6.14]) and parastomal hernia (OR [95% 
      CI], 2.41 [1.70-3.40]). CONCLUSION: Increased BMI is a risk factor for certain 
      DLI-related complications, particularly stoma-site incisional hernia. If 
      feasible, mesh placement at the ileostomy site should be strongly considered for 
      patients with a BMI > 25 to reduce the risk of stoma-site incisional hernia. 
      Weight loss prior to DLI and reversal should be encouraged.

LID - 10.1016/j.arcped.2025.04.003 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acute leukaemia is typically identified through clinical signs of 
      cytopenia and/or a tumour syndrome, while paraneoplastic syndromes are rare in 
      this context. We report a unique case of a 10-year-old girl who initially 
      presented with inflammatory joint pain, night sweats, weight loss, amenorrhea, 
      breast swelling, and galactorrhoea. OBSERVATION: At diagnosis, she had an 
      elevated prolactin (PRL) level (260.5 mug/L, reference < 25 mug/L) and biological 
      evidence of hypogonadism. Blood counts revealed anaemia, thrombocytopenia, and 11 
      % circulating blasts. Bone marrow aspiration confirmed acute leukaemia, 
      classified as FAB M5, with a KAT6A:CREBBP fusion transcript. DISCUSSION: 
      Cerebrospinal fluid analysis was negative for blasts, and brain magnetic 
      resonance imaging showed no leukemic infiltration of the pituitary gland or a 
      concomitant pituitary tumour. PRL level normalized following chemotherapy. 
      CONCLUSION: In the absence of central nervous system involvement, ectopic PRL 
      secretion by leukemic blasts appears to be the most plausible explanation for the 
      elevated PRL levels in this case.

LID - 10.1016/j.soard.2025.05.016 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Eating behavior has been suggested to be influenced by the interplay 
      between chemosensory perception and gut microbiota. Although both factors have 
      been suggested to be altered in obesity and modified by bariatric surgery, there 
      is little evidence about the influence of preoperative smell and taste perception 
      on weight loss outcomes following bariatric surgery, as well as their association 
      with gut microbiota. OBJECTIVES: To assess the predictive role of smell and taste 
      perception in weight loss trajectory after sleeve gastrectomy. SETTING: Vithas 
      Santa Catalina Hospital in Las Palmas, Spain. METHODS: This study included 35 
      patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy. Smell and taste assessments and gut 
      microbiota composition analysis were performed before bariatric surgery and 18 
      months postsurgery. Patients were classified according to the 50th percentile 
      (50P) of the total taste score and olfactory 
      Threshold-Discrimination-Identification (TDI) score. RESULTS: Patients with 
      TDI>50P showed significantly higher percentage of excess weight loss (%EWL) (P = 
      .035) and their gut microbiota was enriched in Flavonifractor, Ruminococcaceae 
      (genus Incertae Sedis), Eggerthella, Sellimonas, and GCA-900,066,575, whilst 
      patients with TDI<50P showed an enrichment in Eubacterium ruminantium group and 
      Lachnospiraceae UCG-001. %EWL was significantly higher in patients with total 
      taste score >50P (P = .049) and their microbiota were enriched in Sutterellaceae, 
      Barnesiellaceae, Roseburia, Lachnospiraceae_UCG-004, Bilophila, Bilophila 
      wadsworthia, Monoglobaceae and Monoglobus, whilst patients with total taste score 
      <50P showed an enrichment in Lactobacillaceae, Lactobacillus, Klebsiella, 
      Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Streptococcus parasanguinis. CONCLUSIONS: Chemosensory 
      perception could play a role in weight loss trajectory after sleeve gastrectomy 
      through the microbiota-gut-brain axis.

AB  - BACKGROUND: - Glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1)-based therapies induce a clinically 
      relevant weight loss, which is associated with overall better prognosis in people 
      with type 2 diabetes and/or clinical obesity. However, a risk of excessive 
      reduction in fat-free mass (FFM) and skeletal muscle mass (SSM), potentially 
      leading to sarcopaenia in at-risk patients, is currently a matter of debate as 
      this negative effect could minimize their benefit/risk balance. METHODS: - An 
      extensive literature search to detect animal and human studies that investigated 
      the effects of GLP-1-based therapies on changes in body composition (FFM and 
      SMM), muscle strength, structure, and function. RESULTS: - Favourable effects on 
      SMM, intramuscular lipid deposition, inflammation and mitochondrial health were 
      consistently reported in different rodent models with GLP-based therapies. 
      However, mixed results were reported in human studies, some reported an excessive 
      FFM/SMM loss while others arguing for a protective effect against sarcopaenia 
      (including less myosteatosis). This controversy may result from misinterpretation 
      of SMM derived from FFM changes and a lack of studies that properly investigate 
      SMM, muscle function and structure in humans. CONCLUSION: - Maximizing fat loss 
      while preserving lean (muscle) tissue mass and function is a central goal of 
      modern obesity pharmacological treatments. Currently, available data preclude to 
      have a definite conclusion about positive/negative effects of GLP-1-based 
      therapies on muscle. Further investigations using accurate methodologies to 
      assess not only SMM but also muscle structure, function (strength) and 
      performance are needed to better analyse the effects of GLP-1-based therapies, 
      especially among individuals at higher risk of sarcopaenia, older patients and 
      frail people.

AB  - Many people worldwide suffer from wound infections, leading to a high one-year 
      mortality rate. This emphasizes the need for improved wound dressings and 
      management techniques. While various materials and fabrication methods have been 
      studied, the potential of electrospun gelatin and polyvinyl alcohol scaffolds 
      with TiO(2) nanoparticles (TiO(2)-NPs) as wound dressings has not yet been 
      explored. This study focuses on investigating the effect of adding TiO(2)-NPs to 
      electrospun gelatin/PVA wound dressings on the morphology and properties such as 
      water contact angle, tensile properties, porosity, water vapor transmission rate 
      (WVTR), in vitro degradation, and biocompatibility. The addition of TiO(2)-NPs 
      changed the random morphology of the fibrous composites to aligned fibers and 
      increased the average fiber diameter due to the increase in the viscosity of the 
      electrospinning solution. It also increased the hydrophilicity and improved the 
      mechanical properties of the composites, and the tensile strength was increased 
      to 10.2 MPa. On the other hand, TiO(2)-NPs did not affect the porosity and WVTR. 
      The composites showed sufficient degradation (32-75 % weight loss) within 
      3-7 days, which makes them promising candidates for wound drug delivery 
      applications. All composites showed acceptable sustained cell viability during 
      3 days of incubation.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: Low-sodium oxybate (LXB) is approved in the United States for treating 
      cataplexy or excessive daytime sleepiness in patients aged >/=7 years with 
      narcolepsy and idiopathic hypersomnia in adults. This post hoc analysis evaluated 
      LXB effects on weight in patients with narcolepsy or idiopathic hypersomnia from 
      two phase 3 studies. METHODS: Adults with narcolepsy with cataplexy or idiopathic 
      hypersomnia began LXB treatment during open-label titration (10-14 weeks), 
      followed by 2-week stable-dose periods (SDP). RESULTS: Safety populations 
      comprised 201 participants with narcolepsy (75 previously taking sodium oxybate) 
      and 148 with idiopathic hypersomnia (oxybate-naive at study entry); most were 
      overweight or obese at baseline (narcolepsy, 67 %; idiopathic hypersomnia, 60 %). 
      Least-squares (LS) mean (95 % CI) weight changes at end of SDP were -1.0 (-2.2, 
      0.1), -3.5 (-4.7, -2.3), and -2.3 (-3.4, -1.1) kg in oxybate-naive participants 
      with narcolepsy and normal weight, overweight, and obese, respectively, and 0.0 
      (-1.6, 1.6), -0.7 (-2.2, 0.8), and 0.3 (-1.1, 1.7) kg in participants with 
      narcolepsy previously taking oxybate and normal weight, overweight, and obese, 
      respectively. In oxybate-naive participants with idiopathic hypersomnia, LS mean 
      (95 % CI) changes at end of SDP were -2.2 (-3.5, -0.8), -2.6 (-4.1, -1.2), and 
      -3.4 (-4.9, -1.8) kg in normal weight, overweight, and obese participants, 
      respectively. Weight loss >/=5 % at end of SDP occurred in 26 % of oxybate-naive 
      participants with narcolepsy, 5 % of those with narcolepsy previously taking 
      oxybate, and 30 % with idiopathic hypersomnia. CONCLUSION: Open-label LXB was 
      associated with modest weight loss in participants with narcolepsy with cataplexy 
      or idiopathic hypersomnia.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Tuberculosis remains a serious challenge in public health worldwide. 
      Changes in patients' delays in diagnosis and illness can complicate the disease. 
      Understanding the factors affecting the delays is crucial to the development of 
      effective prevention and treatment strategies. OBJECTIVES: The aim of our study 
      is to analyze and identify the association between the duration of illness, 
      weight status and changes in dietary habits of TB patients as well as addressing 
      the importance of dietary habits in improving tuberculosis outcomes. METHODS: A 
      cross-sectional study was carried out on a sample of 480 tuberculosis patients. 
      RESULTS: The results revealed that the mean (SD) duration of the disease was 5.98 
      months (6.8), while the mean (SD) diagnostic duration was 3.35 months (6.01). 
      Significant difference was observed in diagnostic duration between TB types (p = 
      0.018). Mean weight loss during the disease (SD) was 7.34 kg (5.21) with a 
      significant difference between age groups (p < 0.001) and between TB types (p < 
      0.001). During the disease, patients lost an average of 1.72 kg/m(2) of their BMI 
      (p < 0.001). Around 84 % of patients have changed their eating habits. Weight 
      loss and changes in dietary habits were significantly associated with increased 
      disease duration. CONCLUSIONS: Changes in eating habits, marked by weight loss 
      and reduction in patients' food intake significantly prolonged the disease's 
      duration. Healthcare professionals are called to be aware of the impact of eating 
      habits on the progression and duration of tuberculosis, and to encourage their 
      patients to adopt healthy eating practices.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Metabolic bariatric surgery (MBS) is an effective treatment for 
      obesity and its related comorbidities.1 Publicly funded MBS in New Zealand is 
      regionally limited with variable case volumes, potentially limiting surgical 
      training.2 This retrospective study aims to evaluate if MBS safety and 
      effectiveness are impacted by teaching within a low-volume unit. METHODS: A 
      retrospective outcomes analysis was carried out for all MBS cases of a single 
      surgeon (public and private). Cases were compared based on primary operator 
      status: consultant (COP) and trainee/fellow (TOF). Primary outcomes included 
      multiple safety and effectiveness parameters including leaks, haemorrhage, 30-day 
      morbidity and total weight loss (TWL). RESULTS: Two-hundred and fifty patients 
      satisfied inclusion criteria. Results are reported as COP and TOF. Primary 
      operator: 87 (34.8%) and 163 (65.2%). There were no leaks, strictures or 30-day 
      mortalities. Perioperative haemorrhage: 1 and 4. Thirty-day morbidity: 1 and 5. 
      One-year TWL: 36.0% and 35.0%. Sleeve stenosis: 0 and 1. Thirty-day readmissions: 
      1 and 4. One-year readmissions: 4 and 9. Length of stay: 3 and 4 (p=<0.001). 
      CONCLUSION: MBS safety and effectiveness outcomes in low-volume practice 
      performed by TOF were no different to COP within our study setting.

AB  - Acute exposure to diisopropylfluorophosphate (DFP), an organophosphate (OP), 
      produces chronic neurological effects such as spontaneous seizures and behavioral 
      comorbidities. Achieving optimal drug bioavailability in the brain by 
      conventional routes to treat OP-induced neurotoxicity is challenging. Therefore, 
      we investigated polyanhydride nanoparticles (NPs)-mediated drug delivery via the 
      intramuscular route in rats for improved bioavailability of an antioxidant, NADPH 
      oxidase inhibitor mitoapocynin (MPO). We evaluated the tolerability of blank NPs 
      (4mg, i.m.), MPO-encapsulated NPs (MPO-NP, 4mg, i.m., single dose), and free 
      MPO-oral (60mg/kg, daily for three days) after exposure to DFP. Bodyweight, serum 
      biochemistry, and kidney, lung, and liver histology revealed no adverse responses 
      to blank NPs. Markers of oxidative stress, neuronal loss, and astrocyte 
      reactivity were also no different from control. In DFP-exposed animals treated 
      with MPO-NP and MPO-oral, there was significant weight loss, abnormal liver and 
      kidney parameters, and elevated GP91phox and astrocytes in the brain. Our 
      findings demonstrate that NP delivery via the intramuscular route is safe. DFP 
      and MPO induced off-target effects, but not DFP or MPO treatment alone, which 
      highlights the complexity of dosing regimens in OP models. Intranasal MPO-NP 
      delivery and dose optimization in the DFP model are required to determine the 
      efficacy of MPO in future studies.

TI  - Brief coaching intervention to reverse weight regain during weight loss 
      maintenance: a preliminary randomized controlled trial.
LID - 10.1007/s10865-025-00582-x [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: Most individuals who complete a behavioral weight loss intervention 
      (BWLI) regain weight. The current study is a preliminary investigation into the 
      efficacy of a telephone coaching intervention to aid recovery from weight regain 
      during weight loss maintenance. METHODS: Participants (n = 77) who had recently 
      completed a BWLI and had lost >/= 5% of their initial body weight were instructed 
      to engage in daily weighing using a ""smart"" scale. Participants were randomized 
      to receive four consecutive weeks of brief coaching phone calls or no 
      intervention. Randomization was activated when individuals regained > 1.5% of 
      their baseline weight. Assessments were completed at baseline and 12 months. 
      RESULTS: Sixty-six participants (M +/- SD age = 54.2 +/- 9.9 years, 68% female) 
      regained > 1.5% and were included in analyses. Individuals who received coaching 
      completed 3.9 +/- 0.5 calls and showed statistically-significant improvements in 
      weight compared to the control group in the short-term (i.e., from randomization 
      activation to 40 days later; M+/-SE Coaching: -1.05%+/-0.30 vs. Control: 0.37%+/-0.31, 
      p < 0.001). However, there were not significant differences in weight regain by 
      group at the 12-month study end (Coaching: 5.18%+/-0.72 vs. Control: 5.71%+/-0.76, 
      p = 0.62). CONCLUSIONS: Brief telephone coaching is a promising intervention for 
      reversing short-term weight regain. Future research should focus on improving the 
      coaching intervention to promote long-term weight loss maintenance, including 
      exploration into offering multiple rounds of coaching. CLINICAL TRIAL

      long-term outcomes and potential predictors.
PG  - 78
LID - 10.1007/s11102-025-01550-z [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Patients with Cushing's syndrome (CS) have higher weight and body 
      mass index (BMI) compared to matched controls. We aimed to assess reversibility 
      of weight gain (absolute weight and BMI decrease) following treatment for CS and 
      identify predictors for weight loss. METHODS: A retrospective study using the 
      Clalit Health Services database analyzed a cohort of patients with CS and age-, 
      sex- and BMI-matched controls (up to five controls per case). Weight and BMI were 
      assessed at baseline, one-year post-diagnosis and at the end of follow-up. 
      Patients taking GLP-1 have been excluded from the analysis. RESULTS: The cohort 
      included 308 CS patients (67.2% female, mean age 51.6 +/- 17.4 years) and 1,020 
      controls (69.7% female, mean age 54.8 +/- 16.9 years). After one year, CS patients 
      who achieved remission experienced significant weight reduction from 85.1 +/- 21.0 
      to 80.8 +/- 22.7 kg and BMI decrease from 31.6 +/- 7.4 to 29.9 +/- 7.4 kg/m(2) 
      (p < 0.01). By the end of 8.6 years of follow-up, CS patients continued to show 
      significant reductions in both weight (85.0 +/- 22.3 to 81.3 +/- 22.8 kg, p < 0.01) 
      and BMI (31.2 +/- 7.6 to 29.9 +/- 7.6 kg/m(2), p < 0.01), while controls showed 
      slight increases in both. Among patients in remission by the end-of-follow-up, 
      44.0% (77/175) achieved >/= 5% and 30.3% (53/175) achieved >/= 10% weight loss. 
      Patients with persistent CS exhibited no significant weight changes. Multivariate 
      analysis identified female gender, baseline BMI >/= 30 and a BMI decrease >/= 1 kg/m(2) 
      at one year, as predictors for >/= 5% weight loss. CONCLUSION: Approximately half 
      of CS patients in remission achieved at least 5% decrease in BMI with long-term 
      follow-up, and a third achieved more than 10% decrease. Disease remission, female 
      gender, baseline BMI >/= 30, and early BMI reduction, predicted a clinically 
      significant weight loss.

TI  - Alopecia in Female Athletes Using Androgenic and Anabolic Steroids: 
      Pathophysiology and Management.
LID - 10.1111/ijd.17941 [doi]
AB  - Performance-enhancing substances (PES) are used by many athletes worldwide to 
      improve performance and enhance appearance. Although PES are more commonly used 
      by men, use is increasing among women, leading to growing physical and 
      psychosocial concerns. Illegal PES include androgenic and anabolic steroids 
      (AAS), which represent a diverse class of synthetic derivatives of testosterone. 
      PES use has been linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular, metabolic, 
      endocrine, neurologic, infectious, hepatic, renal, and musculoskeletal disorders. 
      Additionally, hormonal alterations secondary to PES use can induce or accelerate 
      female pattern hair loss (FPHL). Despite the widespread prevalence of FPHL, 
      research has disproportionately focused on male pattern hair loss (MPHL) and male 
      athletes utilizing PES. This review article explores the pathophysiology of 
      testosterone, gender-based AAS dosing implications, incidence of FPHL, physical 
      and psychosocial impacts of alopecia, and management strategies. Though research 
      regarding the impact of androgen-based PES on hair health exists, few studies 
      address these issues in the context of female athletes. Importantly, clinicians 
      must be equipped to provide female athletes with education regarding potential 
      risks of AAS and to appropriately manage FPHL in this patient population. 
      Furthermore, timely diagnosis and treatment of FPHL, alongside AAS cessation, are 
      crucial to preventing further hair loss and optimizing the safety and efficacy of 
      alopecia treatments. Given the compounded psychosocial concerns among female 
      athletes worldwide on PES-including hair loss, body image insecurities, and even 
      eating disorders-ongoing research in this area is critical.

TI  - Comorbidities Associated With Lichen Planopilaris: A Systematic Review and 
      Meta-Analysis.
LID - 10.1111/ijd.17925 [doi]
AB  - Lichen planopilaris (LPP) is a primary cicatricial alopecia suggested to be 
      associated with various comorbid medical conditions, including autoimmune, 
      endocrine, and metabolic disorders. However, there is conflicting data regarding 
      these associations. This study quantitatively evaluated the prevalence and odds 
      of comorbidities among patients with LPP. PubMed/MEDLINE, EMBASE, Cochrane 
      Library, and Web of Science were searched from inception to December 25, 2023, to 
      include observational studies reporting prevalent/incident cases of at least one 
      comorbidity in LPP patients. The study adhered to the guidelines of the Preferred 
      Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-analyses (PRISMA). Risk-of-bias 
      assessment was performed using the Newcastle-Ottawa scale. Random-effect models 
      were utilized to analyze available data. Of the 2535 studies screened, 59 studies 
      were included for meta-analysis, comprising 15,178 LPP patients and 64,735,181 
      non-LPP controls. Among LPP patients, comorbidities with the highest risk (odds 
      ratio, OR [95% confidence interval, Cl]; prevalence) compared with non-LPP 
      controls and data available from more than one study included lichen planus 
      (15.78 [1.79-139.30]; 6.5%), psoriasis (3.55 [1.10-11.51]; 4.3%), rosacea (3.15 
      [2.25-4.40]; 10.4%), melanoma (3.11 [1.41-6.87]; 2.3%), systemic lupus 
      erythematosus (3.06 [2.29-4.09]; 1.8%), cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (3.04 
      [1.64-5.66]; 4.8%), vitiligo (2.89 [1.60-5.24]; 2.0%), coronary artery disease 
      (1.66 [1.46-1.88]; 7.6%), rheumatoid arthritis (1.50 [1.22-1.84]; 3.5%), 
      hypothyroidism (1.48 [1.12-1.96]; 17.8%), thyroiditis (1.26 [1.08-1.48]; 3.9%), 
      and iron deficiency anemia (1.18 [1.05-1.33]; 9.1%). LPP is significantly 
      associated with autoimmune disorders, thyroid diseases, and skin cancer. Further 
      investigation is required to elucidate the underlying pathogenesis and establish 
      appropriate screening criteria.

TI  - Unequal NHS wig provision: toupee or no toupee, that is the question?
LID - llaf282 [pii]

AB  - Wigs are a necessary medical orthotic for some with alopecia to participate in 
      society. However, for those with limited incomes, government funded National 
      Health Service (NHS) wig provision is of great help. Recent reports to Alopecia 
      UK, a patient support group, suggest restrictions in this support. The 
      availability of NHS wig provision by UK geographical region was assessed by 
      surveying dermatology secondary care healthcare professionals. There were 75 
      responses from 48/136 (35%) of UK Trusts and Health Boards. It was difficult for 
      clinicians at 24/48 (50%) institutions to prescribe wigs. Wig provision was 
      impossible for 11%. There was regional variation; it was straightforward 
      throughout Scotland and the South West of England but difficult in Northern 
      Ireland and London, where 50% reported it was impossible or nearly impossible. 
      This demonstrates unwarranted variation in wig prescription difficulty for 
      patients across the UK.

      study.
LID - llaf268 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ced/llaf268 [doi]
AB  - This study investigated the potential link between finasteride, commonly used for 
      hair loss, and suicide attempts via self-poisoning. It was motivated by concerns 
      over unanticipated psychological side effects like suicidality identified in 
      post-trial adverse event reports. We used data from multiple Danish health 
      registry to assess males reported for suicidal intent poisoning. Each case was 
      matched with ten controls based on age, sex, and residential municipality. We 
      collected data on finasteride prescriptions up to one year before the index date, 
      which was the date of the suicide attempt for cases and the inclusion date for 
      controls. The study included 3,366 cases and 33,660 controls. Adjustments were 
      made for diagnosed bipolar disorder and schizophrenia, as well as occupational 
      status. The analysis showed no link between finasteride use and suicide attempt 
      risk, with an unadjusted odds ratio of 1.03 (95% CI: 0.56-1.88) and an adjusted 
      odds ratio of 0.88 (95% CI: 0.45-1.71).

PG  - 160
LID - 10.1007/s00296-025-05910-7 [doi]
AB  - A scoping review was conducted to compile evidence on sex-specific differences in 
      systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) with focus on autoantibodies, organ 
      manifestation, damage, treatment and patient-reported outcomes (PROs). Systematic 
      searches in PubMed and Cochrane were performed including meta-analyses, 
      observational studies and clinical trials from 01/2015 to 11/2024. Studies of 
      adults with SLE reporting outcomes by sex were eligible. The research protocol is 
      registered in the Registry for Scoping Reviews (OSF, https://osf.io/gfbs9 ). From 
      373 screened articles, 81 publications were included. Studies comprised 
      differences in autoantibodies (n = 13), damage (n = 40), organ involvement 
      (n = 27), treatment (n = 14), and PROs (n = 6). Twenty studies compared 
      proportions of outcomes by sex with patient numbers ranging from 98 to 11,943. 
      The female/male ratio was between 4:1 and 11:1. The review found a higher age at 
      onset in men and a higher proportion of positive lupus anticoagulant, nephritis, 
      serositis, antiphospholipid syndrome, greater renal and cardiovascular damage and 
      severe infections. SLE in women more often presented with Ro/SSA autoantibodies, 
      alopecia, photosensitivity, Raynaud, and osteoporosis. Some studies showed more 
      frequent cyclophosphamide and less frequent antimalarials in men. Little evidence 
      indicated more frequent non-adherence with azathioprine and mycophenolate in 
      women. Limited evidence was available for PROs. This review confirms significant 
      sex differences in SLE, with men showing later onset, more severe organ damage, 
      and distinct autoantibody and treatment patterns, while women more often present 
      with Ro/SSA autoantibodies, photosensitivity, and osteoporosis. Evidence on 
      patient-reported outcomes remains limited, highlighting the need for further 
      research to guide sex-specific management.

TI  - Perceived Stigma and Mental Health Disorders Among Adults With Alopecia Areata 
      Living in Japan.
LID - 10.1111/1346-8138.17831 [doi]
AB  - Alopecia areata (AA) is a common disorder that causes hair loss and can 
      significantly impact quality of life, which may be partially due to AA-related 
      stigma. Examining the impact of AA on psychosocial health is important for 
      understanding the burden experienced by patients with AA. The primary objective 
      of this study was to examine mental health and sleep conditions, hair growth 
      satisfaction, and AA-related stigma perceptions among individuals diagnosed with 
      AA in Japan. The study used patients' self-reported data collected from the 
      National Health and Wellness Survey conducted in Japan in 2023. Collected data 
      included demographic characteristics and comorbidities; among those with a 
      self-reported clinical diagnosis of AA, additional information on clinical 
      characteristics, treatments, and perceived AA-related stigma was captured. 
      Results were analyzed and stratified by self-assessed disease severity. Among the 
      full sample (30 013 adults living in Japan), 471 respondents reported a clinical 
      diagnosis of AA, including 347 mild cases, 100 moderate cases, and 24 severe 
      cases. A diagnosed mental health disorder in the past year was reported by 57 
      respondents (12.1%), and 67 (14.2%) reported a diagnosed sleep condition in the 
      past year. Less than half of respondents (47.4%) were satisfied with their 
      current hair growth, and satisfaction decreased with increasing disease severity. 
      Overall, 70.3% of respondents reported feelings of embarrassment, 55.0% felt that 
      others judged them negatively, and 50.3% felt that others treated them negatively 
      due to AA. A higher proportion of respondents with a severe case (54.2%) reported 
      feeling embarrassed to have AA ""very much so"" compared with respondents who had 
      mild (15.3%) or moderate (26.0%) cases. Perceived AA-associated stigma increased 
      with disease severity. Overall, this study demonstrated the prevalence of 
      AA-related disease stigma and mental health conditions among individuals with AA 
      living in Japan, underscoring the importance of mental health support for 
      patients with AA.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Ropeginterferon Alfa-2b in Low-Risk Polycythemia Vera.
LID - 10.4143/crt.2025.552 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: Conventional management of low-risk polycythemia vera (PV), consisting 
      of phlebotomy and aspirin, often fails to adequately control symptoms and 
      hematologic parameters. This study evaluated the efficacy and safety of 
      ropeginterferon alfa-2b (Ropeg) in low-risk PV patients requiring cytoreductive 
      therapy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: In this sub-analysis of an open-label, 
      multicenter trial, 42 patients received Ropeg for 48 weeks. The primary endpoint 
      was a reduction in phlebotomy frequency, while secondary endpoints included 
      complete hematologic response (CHR), changes in JAK2V617F allele burden, and 
      safety. RESULTS: Among 42 patients, Ropeg significantly reduced mean phlebotomy 
      frequency per year from 3.0 to 0.5 (p < 0.05) and improved CHR rates (69.1% at 48 
      weeks). The JAK2V617F allele burden decreased, and hydroxyurea-naive patients 
      showed better responses. The most frequently reported treatment-related adverse 
      events included elevated liver enzymes and alopecia. Most adverse events were 
      mild or moderate, with no grade 4 or 5 events reported. CONCLUSION: These 
      findings suggest that Ropeg is a promising treatment option for low-risk PV by 
      effectively reducing the need for phlebotomy and demonstrating efficacy and 
      safety.

TI  - The Current State of Patient Adherence to Lab Monitoring Guidelines for Janus 
      Kinase Inhibitors in Patients with Alopecia Areata.
PG  - 26-28
AB  - BACKGROUND: While Janus kinase inhibitors (JAKi) show excellent outcomes in 
      Phase2b/3 trials for alopecia areata (AA), they do have potential side effects 
      due to their immunosuppressive nature and other effects on the JAK-STAT pathway. 
      These side effects can be mitigated by adherence to lab monitoring. OBJECTIVE: 
      The authors sought to analyze patients, using JAKi, to manage symptoms of AA, to 
      determine frequency of lab monitoring and check for adherence to the recommended 
      rate of every three months. METHODS: A retrospective chart review was conducted 
      by first identifying all patients diagnosed with AA at a specialty hair clinic in 
      an academic dermatology department between January 2021 and May 2024. Each 
      patient chart was reviewed for past and current use of any known oral JAKi. 
      Fifty-seven patients were identified to meet our inclusion criteria and all of 
      their charts were reviewed. The primary outcome is the average time between lab 
      monitoring dates for each patient. The hypothesis was formulated after the data 
      collection in the form of whether patients were being adherent to lab monitoring 
      protocol. RESULTS: Most patients were non-adherent to the lab testing frequency 
      standard. Significant differences were found in blood test times between adherent 
      and non-adherent patients and between non-adherent and extremely non-adherent 
      patients with p-values less than 0.01 for both sets. CONCLUSION: Patients with AA 
      undergoing JAKi treatment are not adhering to the recommended lab monitoring 
      frequency. New tactics to improve adherence need to be taken.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a common recurrent chronic inflammatory 
      skin disease, and there is increasing evidence of a possible association between 
      AD and autoimmune diseases. OBJECTIVES: This study aimed to summarize existing 
      epidemiological studies on the association between AD and autoimmune diseases and 
      to perform a meta-analysis of combinable results. METHODS: We conducted a 
      thorough search for cohort studies, case-control studies and cross-sectional 
      studies across the PubMed, Cochrane Library, and Embase databases, from their 
      inception to May 24, 2024, using medical subject headings and relevant keywords. 
      All data were meticulously analyzed using Stata statistical software version 
      17.0. The protocol was registered on PROSPERO (CRD42024547282). RESULT: A total 
      of 26 cohort studies, comprising 1,629,723 patients with atopic dermatitis and 
      15,106,889 control subjects, were included in this meta-analysis. These studies 
      were published between 2014 and 2024 and included 19 cohort studies, 2 
      case-control studies, and 5 cross-sectional studies. The current study 
      demonstrated a significant association of atopic dermatitis with autoimmune 
      diseases[HR 1.49, 95% CI (1.31-1.70); P<0.001], including celiac disease, 
      systemic lupus erythematosus, Sjogren's syndrome, ankylosing spondylitis, 
      alopecia areata, rheumatoid arthritis, vitiligo, thyroid dysfunction, ulcerative 
      colitis. CONCLUSION: The results of our study indicate a clear association 
      between atopic dermatitis and autoimmune diseases, both in adults and children. 
      Additionally, women were more likely to have autoimmune disease complications 
      than men. However, due to the limited number of participants in our study, 
      further research is needed to thoroughly investigate the relationship. SYSTEMATIC

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs) play crucial roles in hair growth 
      and are expected to be potential targets in regenerative medicine and tissue 
      engineering. METHOD: This study aims to investigate the positive effect on hair 
      growth by the recombinant human collagen complex (RHC complex), composed of rhCOL 
      III, rhCOL XVII, and rhCOL XXI, along with nicotinamide, both in vitro and in 
      vivo, by HFSCs and rat models. The survival rate, function, and differentiation 
      of HFSCs were investigated. RESULTS: The CCK-8 experiment showed that the RHC 
      complex was non-toxic to HFSCs, and the cell survival rate exceeded 80% after 8 
      and 16 h of treatment. The ELISA method showed that the RHC complex significantly 
      increased the intracellular vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) levels. In 
      addition, the increase in the content of trichohyalin (a key structural protein 
      of hair) indicates that the structure and function of hair follicles may be 
      enhanced. The expression levels of beta-integrin and p63 were significantly 
      upregulated, which are crucial for cell adhesion, migration, and maintenance of 
      HFSCs homeostasis. In the rat model, significant hair growth was observed after a 
      7-day treatment period. The period of vigorous hair growth in rats was selected 
      for immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and 
      hematoxylin-eosin (HE) staining analysis. The results showed that the RHC complex 
      could promote the expression of Integrin, Laminin and Perlecan, which were 
      conducive to maintaining the stability of the microenvironment of HFSCs. 
      Additionally it facilitated the migration and differentiation of HFSCs, as 
      evidenced by an increased number of hair follicles in HE-stained skin tissues. In 
      conclusion, the RHC complex exhibited high HFSCs survival rates and enhanced the 
      expression of HFSCs-associated factors and basement membrane proteins. These 
      properties make the RHC complex a promising novel ingredient for promoting hair 
      growth, preventing hair loss, and maintaining hair health.

TI  - Development of Ethosomes for the Topical Treatment of Androgenic Alopecia: 
      Ethanol Effect on Dutasteride Targeting to the Hair Follicles.
LID - 786 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics17060786 [doi]
AB  - Background/Objectives: Treatment options for androgenic alopecia are still very 
      limited and lack long-term efficacy. Dutasteride (DUT) has gained interest as a 
      potent inhibitor of 5alpha-reductase, allowing for spaced applications, but DUT oral 
      intake can cause serious adverse effects. Herein, we developed, characterized, 
      and assessed the potential of DUT-loaded ethosomes with increasing ethanolic 
      concentrations for hair follicle (HF) targeting to treat androgenic alopecia, 
      hypothesizing that ethanol's interaction with HFs' sebum might increase DUT 
      targeting to the HFs. Methods: Ethosomes were obtained using the water-dropping 
      method. After a hydrodynamic size screening, a 30% ethanol concentration was 
      fixed. Ethosomes with 30% ethanol were also prepared and had their ethanolic 
      content removed by rotary evaporation for the evaluation of ethanol in targeting 
      DUT to the HFs. The targeting factor (Tf) was calculated as the ratio between the 
      DUT amount in HFs and the total DUT amount recovered from all skin layers after 
      in vitro porcine skin penetration tests for 12 and 24 h. Results: The ethanolic 
      concentration affected the vesicles' size and the targeting potential. While the 
      dried ethosomes could not increase DUT accumulation in the HFs at both time 
      points (Tf: 0.27 in 12 h and Tf: 0.28 in 24 h), the presence of 30% ethanol in 
      the vesicles increased the Tf from 0.28 (12 h) to 0.34 (24 h), significantly 
      superior (p < 0.05) than the dried ethosome and control (Tf: 0.24) in 24 h. 
      Conclusion: Ethosomes with a 30% ethanolic concentration were slightly more 
      efficient in targeting HFs for dutasteride delivery.

TI  - Comparative Analysis of Bacteriome in Hair Follicle Layers of Patients with 
      Female Pattern Androgenic Alopecia.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061365 [doi]
LID - 1365
AB  - Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is the most common form of patterned hair loss, 
      exhibiting gender-specific clinical features. Recent studies highlight the 
      importance of the skin microbiome in maintaining skin health, but the 
      relationship between the hair follicle microbiome and hair loss, particularly 
      AGA, remains understudied. Hair follicle layer samples were collected directly 
      from the crown region of female pattern hair loss (FPHL), male pattern hair loss 
      (MPHL), and healthy adult women (control) groups. Microbial DNA was extracted and 
      analyzed using Illumina 16S rRNA V3-V4 gene amplicon sequencing. Alpha-diversity 
      and beta-diversity analyses and taxonomic and functional profiling were conducted 
      through relative abundance, LEfSe, and PICRUSt2 analyses. The alpha-diversity 
      analysis showed a significant decrease in microbial richness in the hair loss 
      groups. Unweighted UniFrac-based beta-diversity analysis revealed significant 
      clustering between the control group and the FPHL group. Taxonomic profiling and 
      LEfSe analysis identified differences in microbial composition and biomarkers. 
      PICRUSt2 analysis further revealed altered pathways related to porphyrin 
      metabolism, fatty acid biosynthesis, and steroid hormone metabolism. 
      Additionally, differences in microbiome composition and potential functions were 
      found between the FPHL and MPHL groups. This study provides comprehensive 
      insights into the hair follicle microbiome, revealing unique microbial patterns 
      and functional alterations associated with FPHL. Understanding these microbiome 
      characteristics may contribute to targeted approaches for addressing AGA. Further 
      research is warranted.

TI  - Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome and GAD65 related-temporal lobe epilepsy.
LID - 10.1007/s10072-025-08330-4 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Autoimmune polyglandular syndromes (APS) encompass a broad spectrum 
      of disorders. APS III is characterized by autoimmune thyroiditis (AT) plus any 
      autoimmune disorder, excluding Addison's disease. METHODS AND RESULTS: This study 
      explores the link between GAD65 related-temporal lobe epilepsy (GAD-TLE) and APS 
      III. We retrospectively analyzed 29 GAD-TLE patients. Eighteen patients (62%) 
      experienced at least one autoimmune disease, and ten patients (56%) fulfilled 
      diagnostic criteria for APS III. In addition to AT and GAD-TLE, five patients had 
      type 1 diabetes mellitus, one patient had latent autoimmune diabetes in 
      adulthood, one autoimmune alopecia, one pernicious anemia, one had celiac disease 
      and one patient had autoimmune alopecia, vitiligo, autoimmune atrophic gastritis 
      and psoriasis. Approximately 35 years after the onset of the first disease, the 
      probability of having the second disorder is over 80%. In our cohort, GAD65 
      antibodies are more frequently linked to AT than to type 1 diabetes mellitus, 
      despite their well-known association. CONCLUSION: Our data suggests that 
      GAD65-TLE may share a common pathophysiology and should be included among APS-III 
      diagnostic criteria. These insights support the need for rigorous, 
      multidisciplinary monitoring to prevent delays in diagnosis and treatment. This 
      work enhances understanding of APS complexity and informs targeted management 
      strategies for patients with overlapping endocrine and neurological autoimmune 
      disorders.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is one of the most common forms of hair 
      loss, and recent studies suggest that dihydrotestosterone (DHT)-induced 
      senescence of dermal papilla cells (DPCs) plays a crucial role in its 
      pathogenesis. Clinically, we previously observed an overlap between areas exposed 
      to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and regions affected by androgenetic hair loss. 
      However, the relationship between UVA radiation and AGA onset remains unclear. 
      Therefore, we aimed to investigate the role of UVA in intensifying DHT-induced 
      hair loss, with focus on potential activation of cellular senescence pathways. 
      METHODS: We used an AGA mouse model combined with UVA irradiation to examine the 
      role of UVA in delaying DHT-induced hair growth. To further investigate the 
      mechanisms of the interaction between DHT and UVA, we isolated human dermal 
      papilla cells and performed transcriptome sequencing analysis. 
      Senescence-associated beta-galactosidase (SA-beta-Gal) staining, quantitative PCR, and 
      western blotting were used to assess senescence and autophagy. Rapamycin was 
      tested in vivo for its ability to mitigate hair loss. RESULTS: UVA accelerated 
      DHT-Induced hair growth delay in AGA mouse model. UVA exposure intensified 
      DHT-induced cellular senescence in hDPCs. This process was associated with the 
      activation of mTOR pathway. However, rapamycin alleviated UVA- and DHT-induced 
      cellular senescence by modulating autophagy dysfunction. Furthermore, rapamycin 
      effectively reversed UVA-exacerbated DHT-induced hair loss in AGA mouse model. 
      CONCLUSION: UVA exposure can affect autophagy via the mTOR pathway, enhancing 
      DHT-induced cellular senescence in DPCs. Rapamycin shows potential as a 
      therapeutic agent to counteract these effects, offering a novel strategy for 
      treating AGA.

AB  - Androgenetic alopecia, commonly referred to as male or female pattern hair loss, 
      is a prevalent condition encountered in clinical practice. It is important to 
      identify potential underlying causes and differentiate it from other forms of 
      hair loss, which may require referral to a dermatologist for management. 
      Pharmacological treatments for female pattern hair loss include minoxidil 
      (topical and oral) and antiandrogens such as spironolactone. For male pattern 
      hair loss, minoxidil and 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors (e.g. finasteride, 
      dutasteride) can be used. Combination therapy is commonly employed, with clinical 
      improvement typically requiring a minimum of 6 months. Supplements and other 
      treatments have varying levels of evidence, and counselling is important to help 
      patients make informed decisions about their management.

TI  - Evaluation of Atherogenic Indexes in Patients With Lichen Planopilaris: A 
      Case-Control Study.
PG  - e84835
LID - 10.7759/cureus.84835 [doi]
LID - e84835
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Lichen planopilaris (LPP) is a chronic cicatricial alopecia 
      characterized by lymphocytic inflammation leading to permanent hair follicle 
      destruction. It is associated with several systemic conditions, including 
      hypothyroidism, dyslipidemia, hypertension, and an increased risk for 
      cardiovascular disease. This study aims to investigate the relationship between 
      serum lipid parameters and atherogenic indexes to evaluate the cardiovascular 
      risk status in patients with LPP. METHODS: This retrospective study was conducted 
      with 115 LPP patients and 115 healthy controls without LPP. Serum total 
      cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), high-density lipoprotein (HDL), and low-density 
      lipoprotein (LDL) were retrieved from hospital records. Atherogenic Index of 
      Plasma (AIP), Castelli Risk Index (CRI) I and II, and Atherogenic Coefficient 
      (AC) were calculated based on lipid profiles. RESULTS: LPP patients had 
      significantly higher serum TG, total cholesterol, LDL, non-HDL cholesterol, 
      CRI-I, CRI-II, and AC. Additionally, LPP patients were more likely to fall into 
      the high-risk category for CRI-I, CRI-II, and AC. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows 
      that patients with LPP have a higher pro-atherogenic lipid profile and 
      atherogenic indexes. Systemic inflammation and peroxisome proliferator-activated 
      receptor signaling dysregulation may underlie this association, necessitating 
      closer cardiovascular and lipid monitoring in LPP patients.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Hair loss is a prevalent aesthetic concern that impacts the quality 
      of life and self-image of numerous individuals. While topical minoxidil has been 
      extensively utilized in addressing hair loss for several decades, the 
      effectiveness and safety of oral minoxidil are still a topic of debate. Despite 
      its use in certain clinical settings, the precise efficacy and safety of oral 
      minoxidil have not been conclusively validated. Hence, conducting a one-arm rate 
      meta-analysis and systematic review to assess the efficacy and safety of oral 
      minoxidil in treating alopecia holds significant importance. This endeavor aims 
      to furnish additional evidence to support clinical practice and offer guidance 
      for future research in this domain. METHODS: We conducted a comprehensive search 
      on electronic databases including PubMed, Embase, Cochrane Library, and Web of 
      Science from their inception up to 1 October 2024. The primary objective was to 
      assess both the efficacy (measured by the degree of symptom improvement) and 
      safety (including adverse event incidence) of oral minoxidil in the treatment of 
      hair loss. RESULTS: A total of 2,933 patients from 27 studies were included in 
      the analysis. The efficacy of oral minoxidil for treating alopecia was primarily 
      assessed based on the degree of symptom improvement. Among the participants, 35% 
      (95% CI: 22%-49%) experienced significant symptom improvement, 47% (95% CI: 
      38%-55%) showed symptom improvement, and 26% (95% CI: 16%-37%) had stable 
      symptoms. The incidence of adverse events in the safety evaluation was reported 
      at 27% (95% CI: 18%-36%). CONCLUSION: This systematic review and meta-analysis 
      indicate that individuals with hair loss may derive benefits from oral minoxidil, 
      particularly at doses exceeding 1 mg. Nonetheless, additional research or data is 
      essential to definitively establish its efficacy and safety. SYSTEMATIC REVIEW

OAB - What is this summary about?Alopecia areata ('AA' for short) is an autoimmune 
      disease that causes a person to lose their hair.Ritlecitinib is a medication 
      approved to treat severe AA. It blocks parts of the body's defense system that 
      plays a role in causing hair loss. In this study, patients with AA in the ALLEGRO 
      phase 2b/3 study (also known as ALLEGRO-2b/3) were asked how they felt about 
      their hair growth (meaning hair that grew back). This was done to understand how 
      ritlecitinib, the study drug, affected their satisfaction. Patients reported how 
      they felt by answering a questionnaire. This questionnaire is the Patient 
      Satisfaction with Hair Growth tool.Patients took ritlecitinib for 12 months (48 
      weeks) or took a placebo, a pill that looks the same but has no medicine, for 6 
      months (24 weeks). After 6 months, patients who took placebo then took 
      ritlecitinib for another 6 months.What were the results?This study showed that 
      more patients who took ritlecitinib were satisfied with their overall hair growth 
      and the amount and quality of their hair growth after 24 weeks than patients 
      taking placebo.Patients who took placebo reported high dissatisfaction with their 
      hair growth at Week 24. More patients who switched from placebo to ritlecitinib 
      were satisfied with their hair regrowth at Week 48 than at Week 24. After 48 
      weeks, the number of patients who were satisfied with their hair growth was 
      similar to or larger than the number of patients satisfied with their hair growth 
      after 24 weeks.There was agreement between the satisfaction patients reported 
      with their hair growth and their improvement in hair growth reported by doctors 
      involved in the study.What do the results mean?Adult and adolescent patients who 
      took ritlecitinib reported high levels of satisfaction with their hair growth, 
      which continued over time to Week 48. Patients' reported satisfaction with their 
      hair growth was consistent with the amount of scalp hair growth reported by 
      doctors. This means patients were more satisfied as they grew more hair.[Box: see

TI  - FFA Patient Profile Analysis Based on the Authors' Observations and a Review of 
      the Literature-An Original Survey.
LID - 10.3390/jcm14124346 [doi]
LID - 4346
AB  - Background/Objectives: Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) is a scarring alopecia 
      with an unclear aetiology, primarily affecting postmenopausal women. This study 
      aims to identify potential risk factors contributing to FFA development and 
      progression, as well as provide a clinical profile to aid in the differential 
      diagnosis. Methods: The study included 19 women diagnosed with FFA. The 
      participants completed a 20-question survey based on a literature review of 
      potential risk factors. Statistical analyses were performed to investigate the 
      associations between patient characteristics and FFA. Results: All patients were 
      female and their mean age was 60.58 years (SD = 12.81). In 63.1% of the cases, 
      FFA onset occurred postmenopause, with a mean latency of 8.17 years. In the 
      majority of cases, the diagnostic delay exceeded five years. The average menarche 
      age was 13.68 years (SD = 2.06), whereas late menarche (>/=15 years) was found in 
      two subjects. A history of reproductive organ or breast malignancy was reported 
      by 42.1% of the patients, which frequently required surgery. Most subjects did 
      not receive hormone replacement therapy, or hormonal contraception. The most 
      prevalent comorbidity was hypothyroidism (89.47%). Although smoking was rare 
      among the subjects, hair colouring was quite common, yet no participant underwent 
      scalp aesthetic procedures. In 47.4% of cases, scalp itching or pain was present. 
      Sunscreens were frequently used, mostly on a daily or seasonal basis. 
      Conclusions: FFA predominantly affects women in their early 60s, often following 
      the menopause. In our study, a tendency toward an early menopause and an 
      above-average menarche age of the subjects was observed. In the analysed group, 
      only reproductive and breast cancers were reported, which requires further 
      investigation. Frequent beta-blocker use, second only to levothyroxine, may suggest 
      that they play a role in FFA pathogenesis. Itching and pain of the scalp may 
      contribute to the correct diagnosis, although these symptoms are not universal. 
      Moreover, sunscreens were indicated as a potential trigger, yet avoiding them 
      should not be routinely recommended due to the risk of carcinogenesis. The 
      variability in the diagnostic delay emphasises the need for increasing clinician 
      awareness and conducting further research.

TI  - Progenitor Cell Dynamics in Androgenetic Alopecia: Insights from Spatially 
      Resolved Transcriptomics.
LID - 10.3390/ijms26125792 [doi]
LID - 5792
AB  - Androgenetic alopecia (AGA) is marked by the progressive miniaturization of hair 
      follicles (HFs) and hair thinning, driven by a decline in the progenitor cells 
      critical for hair regeneration. Despite this, the mechanisms responsible for 
      progenitor cell depletion remain largely unclear. To investigate transcriptional 
      alterations in the progenitor cell regions of AGA patients while maintaining the 
      spatial tissue context, we employed the GeoMX Digital Spatial Profiling (DSP) 
      platform, which enables a precise comparison with healthy controls. Our analysis 
      revealed the significant upregulation of genes associated with extracellular 
      matrix (ECM) organization and the epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), 
      including FN1, TWIST1, and TGFB2 in the progenitor cell region of the HFs. 
      Correspondingly, protein expression data confirmed increased levels of the 
      protein products of these genes in the affected areas, underscoring their roles 
      in the disease's progression. These molecular changes suggest an environment 
      conducive to the EMT, potentially contributing to the loss of progenitor cells 
      and indicating a fibrogenic shift within the HF microenvironment. Additionally, 
      our study highlights the influence of peri-infundibular immune cell infiltration 
      on these molecular changes, suggesting that immune-mediated microinflammation may 
      contribute to the fibrogenic environment and progenitor cell loss in the AGA. 
      These findings demonstrate the utility of spatial transcriptomics in identifying 
      potential therapeutic targets and advancing our understanding of AGA's molecular 
      mechanisms, offering avenues for developing targeted treatment strategies.

LID - 1379
AB  - Alopecia areata (AA) is a complex autoimmune disorder with multifactorial 
      pathogenesis. Recent research highlights the gut microbiota as a possible key 
      player in AA pathogenesis through the gut-skin axis: gut dysbiosis may disrupt 
      intestinal barrier integrity and immune tolerance by affecting T regulatory 
      cells, potentially contributing to disease onset and progression. The purpose of 
      this review is to analyze the current evidence on the correlation between gut 
      microbiota and AA, dissecting both the pathogenetic role of its alterations in 
      the onset and progression of disease and its potential role as a therapeutic 
      target.

      history of animals. In recent years, retinoic-acid-related orphan receptor alpha 
      (Roralpha) has been found to participate in the regulation of hair follicle 
      development, yet the underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. This 
      study aims to analyze the regulatory role of Roralpha on the cytoskeleton of hair 
      follicle stem cells (HFSCs). We treated HFSCs with a RORA agonist and 
      subsequently analyzed differential gene expression using qPCR, Western blotting, 
      and immunofluorescence, finding that agonist-induced activation of RORA 
      suppressed the expression levels of cytoskeleton-related genes. Additionally, 
      F-actin staining with phalloidin, followed by migration assays and wound healing 
      tests for cell migration detection, revealed that this process affected the 
      cytoskeletal state of HFSCs and inhibited their migration and adhesion 
      capabilities. We further conducted interaction analyses using CUT&RUN combined 
      with ddPCR and EMSA, demonstrating that RORA can bind to the promoter regions of 
      the Actg1 gene and regulate their transcription. This study contributes to a 
      comprehensive understanding of the regulatory processes involved in hair follicle 
      development and may provide broader insights into the treatment of diseases such 
      as alopecia.

TI  - Lessons from TNF-alpha Inhibitor-induced Alopecia Areata: Does TNF-alpha Operate as a 
      Hair Follicle Immune Privilege Guardian under Inflammatory Conditions?
LID - S0022-202X(25)00473-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jid.2025.04.024 [doi]
AB  - The inhibition of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) signaling with inhibitors 
      (TNFi) like infliximab, adalimumab, or etanercept has become a staple of 
      dermatological and rheumatological therapy. Intriguingly, a sizeable minority of 
      patients under TNFi therapy develop alopecia areata (AA), the most common 
      inflammatory hair loss disease, at a higher prevalence than the general 
      population. This appears paradoxical, since the pro-inflammatory Th1 cytokine 
      TNF-alpha, inhibits hair follicle (HF) growth, but encourages one to reconsider the 
      as yet under-investigated roles of TNF-alpha in human HF physiology. Because AA only 
      affects HFs whose immune privilege (IP) has collapsed, the occurrence of AA under 
      TNFi therapy raises the question if inhibiting TNF-a signaling could be 
      detrimental to the maintenance of HF IP. Here, we probe this question by 
      exploring lesser-known aspects of TNF-alpha biology, notably within the context of 
      skin inflammation. We hypothesize that, under inflammatory conditions, TNF-alpha 
      exerts underappreciated functions as a HF IP guardian, e.g., by stimulating 
      perifollicular immunoinhibitory cells and suppressing IFN-alpha secretion. Thus, TNFi 
      may weaken HF IP and facilitate the onset of AA. We delineate how this 
      provocative hypothesis can be tested experimentally, and why it is both 
      biologically and clinically important to do so.

LID - 589
AB  - A 10-year-old male neutered British Shorthair cat with diabetes mellitus 
      presented with an acute onset of unilateral swelling, erythema, alopecia and 
      coalescing ulcerations of the face and periocular skin. Initial clinical 
      differential diagnoses were trauma, infections (including feline respiratory 
      viruses), arthropod bites, and eosinophilic dermatoses such as eosinophilic 
      granuloma complex, mosquito-bite hypersensitivity and cutaneous adverse drug 
      reaction. Histopathology revealed fulminant furunculosis with abundant 
      eosinophils and vasculitis. Initial topical glucocorticoid treatment partially 
      improved the clinical signs but severely raised serum glucose levels. As a 
      result, systemic glucocorticoids and ciclosporin were not considered optimal 
      treatments, and the off-label and short-term use of oclacitinib was chosen with 
      the owner's informed consent. This treatment induced fast remission of clinical 
      signs with no recurrence for 17 months. Secondary fusion of the eyelids caused by 
      cicatrization was surgically reconstructed to restore full function.

AB  - Real-world use of dupilumab has unveiled a spectrum of side effects that were not 
      fully appreciated in initial clinical trials. While dupilumab remains a highly 
      effective treatment for atopic dermatitis, clinicians must be aware of real-world 
      adverse effects including ocular complications, inflammatory arthritis, 
      psoriasiform eruptions and head and neck dermatitis; as well as reported

      Pattern Hair Loss.
LID - 10.1097/DSS.0000000000004741 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Male and female pattern hair loss (MPHL and FPHL) significantly 
      affect quality of life. This study compares the clinical and trichoscopic 
      outcomes of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) and growth factor concentrate (GFC) in 
      treating patterned hair loss, evaluating their efficacy and safety. OBJECTIVE: To 
      compare the efficacy and side effect profiles of PRP and GFC in treating pattern 
      hair loss and assessing associated trichoscopic changes. METHODS: A retrospective 
      study of 42 patients (21 MPHL and 21 FPHL), divided into Group 1 (PRP, 25 
      patients) and Group 2 (GFC, 17 patients). Each underwent three treatment 
      sessions, 4 weeks apart. Evaluations included trichoscopy, clinical photography, 
      and the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS). RESULTS: GFC showed better 
      outcomes in total hair count, shaft diameter, and GAIS score than PRP, with 
      significant improvement in hair count after the second session (p < .05). GFC 
      also had more bulbar enlargement (p < .05), while PRP showed more erythema and 
      angiogenesis (p < .05). At 6 months, PRP had better hair diameter and GAIS 
      scores, indicating a more sustained effect. CONCLUSION: PRP and GFC improve hair 
      parameters with choices based on patient preference, cost, and expertise. GFC 
      provides quick improvement, while PRP offers long-term benefits, making 
      sequential treatments ideal for sustainable results.

TI  - Cross-Sectional Analysis of Subclinical Findings Using High-Frequency Ultrasound 
      in Frontal Fibrosing Alopecia.
LID - 10.1002/jum.16751 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Frontal fibrosing alopecia (FFA) has a progressive course; 
      quantifying changes at each visit can be complex. High-frequency ultrasound 
      (HFUS) has been used to assess hair follicle morphology and scalp 
      vascularization. The objectives of the study are to evaluate HFUS characteristics 
      of patients with FFA and, secondarily, to study the usefulness of HFUS in 
      assessing disease activity. METHODS: Prospective study between January and June 
      2018. Patients with confirmed FFA were included. A retrospective analysis of HFUS 
      imaging and its correlation with clinical presentation was performed. RESULTS: 
      Fifteen AFF female patients (median age: 65 years) met the study criteria. A 
      total of 75 ultrasound images were analyzed. The atrophic region exhibited 
      significant dermis thinning (0.7 mm; 0.3-1.2 mm range) compared to healthy sites. 
      Frontal hair growth area showed reduced follicle number and miniaturization. HFUS 
      Doppler ultrasound identified subclinical inflammation in 26.6% of patients. 
      CONCLUSIONS: HFUS allows the characterization of FFA by quantitatively assessing 
      dermal atrophy and the miniaturization and shrinkage of hair follicles. In 
      addition, it allows the diagnosis of subclinical inflammation.

LID - 10.2147/CCID.S523182 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: To explore the efficacy of Follicular Unit Excision (FUE) in treating 
      pediatric secondary cicatricial alopecia. METHODS: We selected 11 cases of 
      patients under 18 years old who underwent treatment for secondary cicatricial 
      alopecia at the Chengdu Hengmei Hair Medical Clinic from January 1, 2021, to 
      December 31, 2022. Among them, there was 1 female and 10 males. All patients 
      underwent FUE procedures. After 12 months, the assessment of the surgical 
      efficacy was evaluated using the Global Aesthetic Improvement Scale (GAIS), and 
      the incidence of complications was recorded. RESULTS: Among the 11 patients, none 
      experienced complications such as infection, skin necrosis, significant hematoma, 
      unnatural appearance, or temporary hair loss. 6 cases (54.5%) were rated as 1 on 
      the GAIS, indicating extreme satisfaction. 2 cases (18.2%) were rated as 2, 
      signifying satisfaction, resulting in an overall satisfaction rate of 72.7%. 1 
      case (9.1%) scored 3, showing limited improvement and dissatisfaction, and 2 
      cases (18.2%) scored 4, indicating no improvement. CONCLUSION: FUE hair 
      transplantation is a safe, minimally invasive, and effective method for treating 
      stable cicatricial alopecia in children, leading to significant aesthetic 
      improvements for the patients. Further studies with larger cohorts are needed to 
      confirm these results and explore long-term outcomes.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: A narrative short review has been made aiming to identify the most 
      important immune disorders associated with the HLA DRB1*allele. MATERIAL AND 
      METHODS: Data have been taken from PubMed, and 36 articles have been retrieved. 
      RESULTS: It has been found that DRB1*16:02 is associated with autoimmune diseases 
      with production of autoantibodies, mainly systemic lupus erythematosus and 
      myasthenia gravis. DRB1*04 is associated with lupus erythematosus, bullous 
      pemphigoid, and pemphigus vulgaris. DRB1*is also associated with dermatitis 
      herpetiformis, alopecia areata, acute generalised exanthematous pustulosis, and 
      systemic sclerosis. No association of DRB1 has been found either with psoriasis 
      or with psoriatic arthritis, while the association of Cw6 and DRB1*07 confers 
      less severe joint damage in patients with psoriatic arthritis. CONCLUSION: DRB1* 
      is associated with lupus erythematosus rheumatoid arthritis and with most immune 
      disorders with skin involvement.

TI  - Clinical and histopathological evaluation of 5-fluorouracil-induced oral

PG  - 1958-1968
LID - 10.5455/OVJ.2025.v15.i5.10 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chemotherapeutics like 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) may induce a variety of 
      adverse effects, including oral mucositis (OM), which may necessitate treatment 
      discontinuation in patients with cancer. Currently, only a few models of OM are 
      available for studying many aspects of pathophysiology and treatments. AIM: The 
      current study examined the clinical and histological aspects of 
      5-fluorouracil-induced oral mucositis (5FU-OM) in rats. METHODS: We randomly 
      divided 19 male Sprague-Dawley rats into 8 healthy rats and 11 that received a 
      single dose of 5FU-OM. On the first day of the experiment, the 5FU-OM group was 
      administered an intraperitoneal injection of 5-FU (150-mg/kg BW), whereas the 
      healthy group was not administered the drug. The third day involved scratching 
      the oral mucosa of all rats in both groups. Clinical observations included 
      changes in body weight, food consumption, hair loss, and severity of oral 
      lesions. At the end of the study, we collected cardiac blood and mucosal tissue 
      samples to investigate hematological and histological alterations. RESULTS: Our 
      findings demonstrated that a single intraperitoneal injection of 5-FU and mucosal 
      irritation might result in ulcerative OM. We discovered other clinical toxicities 
      caused by chemotherapy, such as weight loss, red lacrimation, facial edema, 
      epistaxis, and hair loss. 5-FU also produced hematological abnormalities, 
      including anemia and thrombocytopenia. Histopathological changes included 
      ulceration, bleeding, vasodilation, edema, and inflammatory cell infiltration. 
      CONCLUSION: This simple rat model of OM accurately replicates the clinical and 
      histological mucosal responses to chemotherapy, including its systemic adverse 
      effects. Thus, it can be used in research on OM.

TI  - Psoriatic Alopecia: Clinical Features, Pathogenesis, and Emerging Treatment 
      Strategies.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1159/000545835 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Psoriatic alopecia is a distinct but underrecognized manifestation of 
      psoriasis, leading to both non-scarring and scarring hair loss. While scalp 
      involvement is common in psoriasis, the mechanisms underlying follicular damage 
      and hair loss remain poorly understood. Diagnosis is challenging due to clinical 
      and histopathological overlap with other alopecias, and treatment responses are 
      often variable. SUMMARY: This review examines the clinical presentation, 
      pathogenesis, and management of psoriatic alopecia. The inflammatory process, 
      primarily driven by the Th17/IL-23 axis, contributes to hair follicle disruption, 
      sebaceous gland atrophy, and in severe cases, permanent alopecia. Trichoscopy and 
      histopathology aid in diagnosis, but standardized criteria are lacking. Treatment 
      strategies include topical corticosteroids, vitamin D analogs, and systemic 
      biologics, but some patients remain refractory to conventional therapies. 
      Paradoxical psoriatic alopecia induced by TNF inhibitors further complicates 
      management, necessitating individualized treatment approaches. KEY MESSAGES: 
      Psoriatic alopecia requires greater clinical recognition and research to improve 
      diagnosis and treatment. A deeper understanding of its pathogenesis, particularly 
      immune-mediated follicular damage, could lead to more effective therapies. 
      Personalized treatment approaches, including novel biologics, hold promise for 
      improving patient outcomes, but further studies are needed to optimize long-term 
      management strategies.

LID - e84777
AB  - This literature review aims to analyze the association between mental health 
      disorders and various types of hair loss, including telogen effluvium, 
      androgenetic alopecia, alopecia areata, and compulsive disorders such as 
      trichotillomania. A comprehensive review of recent studies was conducted to 
      explore the bidirectional relationship between psychiatric conditions and hair 
      loss, with emphasis on neurobiological mechanisms and psychosocial consequences. 
      Findings show that psychiatric disorders can contribute to or exacerbate hair 
      loss, while hair loss may lead to psychological symptoms such as anxiety, 
      depression, and body dysmorphic disorder. Proposed mechanisms include immune 
      dysfunction, neuroendocrine imbalance, microinflammation, brain-derived 
      neurotrophic factor (BDNF) depletion, gut-brain-skin axis dysregulation, and 
      medication-induced disruptions in hair cycling. Furthermore, individuals with 
      somatic symptom disorder may report hair loss in the absence of clinical 
      findings, complicating diagnosis and care. This review concludes that an 
      interdisciplinary treatment model integrating dermatological and psychiatric 
      support is essential for accurate diagnosis, effective treatment, and overall 
      patient well-being.

TI  - Controlled Release of Minoxidil through Hydrogel Cross-Linking to Treat 
      Androgenetic Alopecia.
LID - 10.1021/acsbiomaterials.5c00292 [doi]
AB  - Minoxidil is the only FDA approved topical treatment for androgenetic alopecia, 
      which is male- or female-pattern hair loss. However, its use is limited by its 
      efficacy and tolerability. Here, we describe a novel bioengineered approach to 
      improve local delivery to the skin. We showed that Schiff bases form between the 
      diamines of minoxidil and aldehyde-modified hyaluronic acid, leading to 
      cross-linking and formation of injectable hydrogels. Hydrogels exhibited tunable 
      release of minoxidil over 6 weeks in vitro with induction of hair growth in vivo 
      in a mouse model after intradermal injection. To improve delivery, hydrogels were 
      fabricated into hydrogel-forming microneedle patches, which allowed controlled, 
      precise, and uniform delivery of minoxidil into skin. Through our approach, we 
      formed highly mechanically robust microneedle patches with heights of 600 or 800 
      mum with sufficient mechanical strength to penetrate human skin. Minoxidil 
      hydrogel microneedle patches similarly led to anagen induction in a mouse model. 
      Our technology represents a promising new approach to improve minoxidil use and 
      patient outcomes in androgenetic alopecia.

AB  - Baldness is a common bodily change most men experience. It is extensively 
      medicalized. Specifically, it is depicted as a negative disease that only a 
      profitable industry's cosmetic, pharmaceutical and other products can 'treat'. 
      This study aimed to assess whether a short demedicalization intervention, an 
      evidence-based text of around 400 words, could promote acceptance among balding 
      men. An international sample of 350 balding men completed a mixed-method, 
      experimental, survey. Participants were randomized into 1 of 3 conditions with 
      text that medicalized baldness (presented it as a disadvantageous disease 
      requiring 'treatment' akin to anti-baldness advertising), that demedicalized 
      baldness (presented it neutrally in an evidenced-based manner emphasizing 
      informed consent) or with no text (control). Quantitative scale responses 
      indicated lower medicalized coping and higher acceptance coping, but no 
      differences in distress among participants exposed to demedicalized information. 
      The medicalized information did not have an effect on any of the quantitative 
      scales. Participants also qualitatively reported feeling more informed, more 
      accepting, less distressed and less misled in the demedicalized condition than 
      the medicalized condition. Despite negative pressures around baldness, a short 
      demedicalized intervention may be useful to promote more informed, accepting and 
      positive responses to baldness. Such an intervention is scalable and could be 
      distributed easily (e.g., via online articles or videos). Future research should 
      test the feasibility of lengthier interventions to demedicalize baldness and 
      other bodily aspects (e.g., cellulite, genital variation and height).

TI  - Lnc056 Enhances Hair Follicle Stem Cells Proliferation by Binding Transcription 
      Factor HNRNPUL1 to Up-Regulate TRIP6 Expression.
PG  - e70764
LID - 10.1096/fj.202500381R [doi]
AB  - Hair follicles regenerate spontaneously through a cycle of anagen, catagen, and 
      telogen, and this cycle is driven by hair follicle stem cells (HFSCs). Long 
      non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have previously been implicated in hair follicle 
      cycling processes. According to the previous lncRNA sequencing results of 
      cashmere goats, an annotated lncRNA XR_310056.1, referred to as lnc056, was found 
      to be differentially expressed during the hair follicle cycle. Here, the purpose 
      of this study was to determine whether lnc056 affects the proliferation of HFSCs 
      by regulating thyroid hormone receptor interactor 6 (TRIP6) expression in 
      combination with the transcription factor HNRNPUL1. The expression of lnc056 in 
      HFSCs was detected by RT-qPCR. HFSCs were then treated with lnc056 and TRIP6 
      overexpressing adenovirus, si-HNRNPUL1, and si-TRIP6 to detect cell viability and 
      proliferation. In addition, we investigated the binding between lnc056 and 
      HNRNPUL1 or HNRNPUL1 and TRIP6. Finally, the biological function of lnc056 
      through the HNRNPUL1/TRIP6 axis was verified by target gene recovery experiments. 
      Lnc056 was expressed in the nuclei of HFSCs, and its overexpression promoted the 
      proliferation of cells. Moreover, lnc056 was found to bind to the transcription 
      factor HNRNPUL1 and promoted TRIP6 expression. Furthermore, recovery assays 
      demonstrated that lnc056 promoted the proliferation of HFSCs via the 
      HNRNPUL1/TRIP6 axis. In summary, the results of this study suggested that lnc056 
      up-regulated the expression of TRIP6 by binding to the transcription factor 
      HNRNPUL1, thereby accelerating the proliferation of HFSCs. This study enriches 
      the molecular mechanism of lncRNA in the hair follicle cycle and provides a 
      potential therapeutic target for hair loss.

LID - D8436 [pii]
AB  - Myxedema psychosis, also known as myxedema madness, is a rare neuropsychiatric 
      manifestation of untreated or inadequately treated hypothyroidism. We report the 
      case of a 46-year-old woman presenting to the emergency department with acute 
      psychiatric symptoms, including confusion, hallucinations, and delusions. 
      Physical examination revealed classic signs of hypothyroidism, such as 
      periorbital edema, dry skin, and diffuse hair loss. Laboratory results showed a 
      markedly elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) level of 45.76 mU/L and a 
      severely reduced free thyroxine (T4) level (< 1.0 pmol/L), confirming the 
      diagnosis of myxedema psychosis. Intravenous administration of levothyroxine and 
      liothyronine (T3) led to rapid resolution of psychotic symptoms. This case report 
      underscores the critical need to evaluate somatic causes, including 
      hypothyroidism in patients presenting with acute psychiatric symptoms. Timely 
      diagnosis and appropriate thyroid hormone replacement therapy can result in full 
      recovery.

TI  - Association of Male Androgenetic Alopecia with Psychosocial and Sexual Well-being 
      in Early Middle-aged Men: A Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 Study.
PG  - adv43457
LID - 10.2340/actadv.v105.43457 [doi]
AB  - Androgenetic alopecia is the most common type of hair loss in men. It is reported 
      to have a strong effect on the quality of life, especially at a young age. 
      However, there are only a few studies evaluating the relationship between 
      androgenetic alopecia and psychosocial well-being in the general population. This 
      study examined the association of androgenetic alopecia and its severity with 
      psychosocial symptoms and sexual issues at a population level in male subjects 
      aged between 33 and 35 years belonging to the Northern Finland Birth Cohort 1986 
      Study (NFBC1986) (n = 1,027). During 2019 to 2020, cohort subjects participated 
      in a large follow-up study and completed diverse health questionnaires, including 
      information on their hair status, psychosocial symptoms (the Hopkins Symptom 
      Checklist-25 [HSCL-25] and the Generalized Anxiety Disorder Screener [GAD-7]) and 
      sexual health. Androgenetic alopecia was reported as follows: No androgenetic 
      alopecia n = 468 (45.6%), mild n = 435 (42.4%), moderate n = 62 (6.0%), and 
      severe androgenetic alopecia n = 62 men (6.0%). There was no significant

AB  - BACKGROUND: Alopecia is a distressing side-effect of taxane chemotherapy, and 
      evidence suggests that docetaxel leads to chronic alopecia. We measured rates of 
      satisfaction with hair regrowth among women who received adjuvant docetaxel 
      compared with paclitaxel to identify a difference in outcomes. METHODS: We 
      identified adult female patients who received paclitaxel or docetaxel 
      chemotherapy for early breast cancer from 2010 to 2015. They were screened to 
      ensure they were alive, without metastatic relapse or a new cancer. Eligible 
      participants were sent an introductory letter, consent, a Dermatology Life 
      Quality Index (DLQI) questionnaire, a Visual Analogue Score (VAS) and the 
      European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) general and 
      breast-specific quality of life. The primary outcomes were the DLQI: a 10-item 
      questionnaire scored on a 0-3 scale (higher scores indicating distress and 
      dissatisfaction) and the VAS (scored out of 4). Secondary outcomes were the 
      global health status, function, symptom score and breast specific outcomes shown 
      by the EORTC QLQ-C30 and EORTC QLQ-BR23. RESULTS: There were 88 responders from 
      210 letters (response rate 42%); 38 (43%) had docetaxel and 50 (57%) had 
      paclitaxel. They were aged 26-90 (median: 59). There was a significant difference 
      in DLQI scores, with the docetaxel group having a higher median score (docetaxel: 
      4 vs paclitaxel: 1, p = 0.01). A significantly higher proportion of patients 
      reported no effect of hair loss in the paclitaxel group (p = 0.02). Similarly, 
      there was a significant difference in VAS scores with the docetaxel group having 
      a higher median score (docetaxel: 1 vs. paclitaxel: 0.5, p = 0.002). Secondary 
      outcomes did not reach statistical significance. There was no association with 
      aromatase inhibitor exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Our study shows that adjuvant 
      docetaxel chemotherapy is associated with statistically significant higher rates 
      of dissatisfaction and chronic alopecia than paclitaxel chemotherapy. This 
      supports literature and should be discussed prior to administering docetaxel 
      regimens.

TI  - Alopecia areata incognita in men masquerading as androgenetic alopecia: a case 
      series of 29 patients in a single centre experience.
LID - 10.23736/S2784-8671.25.08170-8 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Alopecia areata incognita (AAI) represents a variant of alopecia 
      areata with an absence of well-defined alopecic patches but diffuse involvement 
      of the scalp and even if usually affected females, it may also appear in male. 
      Little is known about AAI in men. The aim of this study was to characterize the 
      history, clinical, trichoscopic, and histopathologic features of AAI in male 
      patients. METHODS: All histopathologically proven male patients with AAI between 
      April 2011 and December 2023, were included in the study. The history, clinical, 
      trichoscopic and histopathologic features of the male patients were evaluated. 
      RESULTS: Twenty-nine patients with AAI were included in the study, the mean age 
      was 23.1. All patients had an underlying androgenetic alopecia (AGA) - Hamilton 
      Scale: 17 (58.62%) grade IV, 9 (31.03%) grade V and 3 (10.34%) grade VI. The most 
      common trichoscopic features included short regrowing hair (96.6%), yellow dots 
      (89.7%) and pigtail hair (41.3%) especially seen in the occipital, parietal and 
      frontal regions. A positive pull test with telogen roots was observed in 24.1% of 
      the patients. Histopathological characteristics of AAI in male patients were 
      indistinguishable from previously described features in female patients. All 
      patients were treated with an ultra-potent topical corticosteroid under occlusion 
      and topical 5% minoxidil twice/day or oral minoxidil, remission was established 
      between 4-8 months after treatment initiation. CONCLUSIONS: A thorough 
      trichoscopic examination in cases of diffuse hair loss in male patients with AGA 
      refractory to conventional therapy is warranted and trichoscopy-guided biopsy is 
      necessary to confirm the diagnosis.

PG  - 1-5
LID - 10.1159/000546084 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Terra firma-forme dermatosis (TFFD) is a benign condition 
      characterized by hyperpigmented patches that resist routine washing yet are 
      removable with isopropyl alcohol. Observing TFFD on the scalp is an exceptional 
      event. CASE PRESENTATION: A 9-year-old female with ectodermal dysplasia and 
      features of diffuse alopecia areata presented with multiple brown patches on the 
      scalp. Trichoscopic examination revealed cluster of brown dots arranged in single 
      files forming multiple curved lines that resemble a fingerprint pattern composed 
      of dots. The lesions were completely removed by rubbing with isopropyl 
      alcohol-soaked gauze. DISCUSSION: This case introduces a novel trichoscopic 
      pattern in scalp TFFD, expanding the diagnostic spectrum of the condition. The 
      rapid resolution with isopropyl alcohol confirms the diagnosis, underscoring the 
      utility of trichoscopy as a noninvasive diagnostic tool in complex scalp 
      disorders.

LID - 1538555
AB  - The B cell-activating factor (BAFF) system, comprising two ligands and three 
      receptors, plays a pivotal role in adaptive and innate immunity, driving 
      autoimmunity through dysregulated B and T cell survival, differentiation, and 
      cytokine production. This review synthesizes evidence linking BAFF system 
      overexpression to multiple autoimmune diseases, including systemic lupus 
      erythematosus (SLE), Sjogren's syndrome (SS), bullous pemphigoid (BP), pemphigus 
      vulgaris (PV), and alopecia areata (AA), where elevated BAFF system molecule 
      levels correlate with autoantibody titers, disease activity, and post-B cell 
      depletion relapse. BAFF-targeted therapies have demonstrated efficacy in reducing 
      disease activity in SLE and SS. Key challenges include interspecies receptor 
      expression discrepancies and context-dependent signalling cascades. Emerging 
      strategies, such as sequential therapy with rituximab followed by belimumab, show 
      promise in treating refractory autoimmune diseases such as BP and PV by 
      counteracting the post-depletion BAFF surge. Despite progress, mechanistic gaps 
      in BAFF-mediated crosstalk between innate and adaptive immunity, as well as 
      interspecies-specific pathogenesis warrant further investigation using humanized 
      disease models and single-cell transcriptomic profiling. This review underscores 
      the therapeutic potential of BAFF system modulation while advocating for 
      disease-specific clinical trials to optimize precision-therapeutic targeting in 
      autoimmune diseases.

TI  - Combined Corticosteroid and Minoxidil Therapy for Early Recovery in 
      Radiation-Induced Alopecia: A Case Report.
PG  - 1495-1499
LID - 10.2147/CCID.S520575 [doi]
AB  - This case report describes a 42-year-old man who developed radiation-induced 
      alopecia after an endovascular embolization procedure for a cerebral 
      arteriovenous fistula. The alopecia appeared as a well-defined patch of hair loss 
      on the right scalp, confirmed by biopsy showing lymphocytic infiltration and 
      increased catagen and telogen follicles. The patient was treated with 
      intramuscular corticosteroid injections and topical 5% minoxidil, leading to 
      complete hair regrowth after three months. Radiation-induced alopecia, though 
      rare and typically self-limiting, requires early diagnosis. This case highlights 
      a novel therapeutic approach combining corticosteroids and minoxidil for faster 
      recovery.

TI  - Autoimmune Polyglandular Syndrome Type 2 Presentation with Alopecia Universalis, 
      Hashimoto's Disease, and Addison's Disease.
PG  - 719-725
LID - 10.2147/IMCRJ.S515059 [doi]
AB  - Autoimmune polyglandular syndrome type 2 (APS2) is characterized by the 
      coexistence of primary adrenal insufficiency with autoimmune thyroid disease 
      and/or type 1 diabetes. APS2 frequently includes conditions affecting 
      non-endocrine organs, such as alopecia, vitiligo, celiac disease, and autoimmune 
      gastritis associated with vitamin B12 deficiency. We report the case of a 
      30-year-old male with a history of Hashimoto's disease and alopecia universalis, 
      who presented with diarrhea, anorexia, hypoglycemia, and abdominal pain. Physical 
      examination revealed orthostatic hypotension, a non-tender abdomen, and 
      generalized hair loss. Initial laboratory workup showed hyponatremia and 
      hyperkalemia. Further testing, including serum cortisol, ACTH, aldosterone, and 
      21-hydroxylase antibodies, confirmed the diagnosis of Addison's disease. The 
      patient was treated with prednisone and fludrocortisone. Only two previous cases 
      of APS2 associated with alopecia universalis have been reported: one with 
      concurrent Crohn's disease and another with hypoparathyroidism. This case 
      highlights the importance of recognizing non-endocrine manifestations in patients 
      with autoimmune endocrinopathies to facilitate earlier diagnosis and management.

AB  - A 21-year-old miniature donkey gelding was evaluated for pruritus, inappetence, 
      hypertriglyceridemia, and alopecia of 2 weeks' duration. Hematology showed 
      moderate eosinophilia, severe hypertriglyceridemia, and moderately increased 
      liver enzyme activities. Cytologic evaluation of peritoneal fluid identified an 
      eosinophilic transudate. The donkey was treated with antihistamines, 
      anthelmintics, IV fluids with dextrose as a constant rate infusion, and insulin. 
      The miniature donkey was euthanized because of the development of laminitis. 
      Lesions associated with multisystemic eosinophilic epitheliotropic disease (MEED) 
      were identified at necropsy.

      Bariatric Surgery and the Impact of Bariatric Surgery on Patients' Lives.
PG  - e70154
LID - 10.1111/jep.70154 [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This qualitative study aimed to examine the reasons why morbidly obese 
      people prefer bariatric surgery and the effect of bariatric surgery on the lives 
      of patients. METHODS: Interviews with the participants who underwent bariatric 
      surgery were completed through a semi-structured interview form. The expressions 
      of the participants were analyzed thematically using the MaxQDA20 software. 
      RESULTS: The participants were 52.9% were female. The study reached three main 
      themes: 'First Experiences After Surgery', 'Reasons for Choosing Bariatric 
      Surgery', and 'The Effects of Bariatric Surgery on Patients' Lives'. It was found 
      that the primary reason for participants to prefer bariatric surgery was 
      'aesthetic appearance/to be liked'. It was determined that the most used code 
      among the positive effects after surgery was 'happiness'. The most used codes for 
      negative effects were 'hair loss' and 'weight regain'. The most repeated code in 
      the first experiences after surgery was 'nausea and vomiting'. CONCLUSION: The 
      participants that revealed results are a significant guide for all morbidly obese 
      people. However, it is recommended to conduct further qualitative and 
      quantitative research on the preference for bariatric surgery and attitudes 
      toward surgery.

TI  - Efficacy and Safety of Biweekly Single-Dose Actinomycin D vs Multiday 
      Methotrexate in Low-Risk Gestational Trophoblastic Neoplasia: A Prospective 
      Multicenter Randomized Trial.
LID - S0923-7534(25)00811-7 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.annonc.2025.06.006 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cure rates for low-risk gestational trophoblastic neoplasia (GTN) are 
      high, but there is no consensus on optimal first-line chemotherapy. Here we 
      evaluated the efficacy and safety of biweekly single-dose actinomycin D (Act-D) 
      versus an 8-day methotrexate-folinic acid (MTX-FA) regimen as first-line 
      single-agent chemotherapy for low-risk GTN. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This 
      multicenter, randomized controlled trial enrolled patients with FIGO stage I-III, 
      low-risk GTN (FIGO 2000 prognostic scores 0-4) across eight centers in China 
      (ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT04562558). Patients were randomized (1:1) to 
      Act-D (1.25 mg/m(2), maximum 2 mg, every 14 days) or MTX-FA (50 mg 
      intramuscularly, days 1, 3, 5, and 7; leucovorin rescue, days 2, 4, 6, and 8). 
      Treatment continued until beta-hCG normalization, followed by 2-3 consolidation 
      cycles. Primary outcomes were complete remission (CR) rates for single-agent 
      chemotherapy and overall CR rates. Secondary outcomes were time to CR, 
      chemotherapy cycles, toxicity, and anti-Mullerian hormone (AMH) changes. RESULTS: 
      Between September 27, 2020, and June 18, 2024, 228 patients were randomized to 
      MTX or Act-D. Act-D achieved significantly higher single-agent CR rates than MTX 
      (72.8% vs. 54.4%, p=0.0038) with shorter median remission time (7.86 vs. 9.43 
      weeks, p=0.0296). Overall CR rates were 100% in both groups following combination 
      chemotherapy for resistant cases. Most adverse events were grade 1-2, but grade 
      >/=2 nausea and vomiting and hair loss were more frequent with Act-D, and ALT was 
      more frequently elevated in the MTX group. AMH reductions were transient in both 
      groups. After a 28.5-month median follow-up, recurrence rates remained low and 
      comparable (MTX: 0.88% vs. Act-D: 0.88%; p>0.05). Fertility outcomes were 
      favorable in both groups. CONCLUSION: Biweekly Act-D demonstrated superior 
      efficacy and faster remission than the 8-day MTX regimen as first-line 
      single-agent chemotherapy for low-risk GTN, offering a well-tolerated option 
      despite a higher incidence of nausea, vomiting, and hair loss.

AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Acne is a common dermatological manifestation of polycystic ovary 
      syndrome (PCOS), a prevalent endocrinological disorder among women of 
      reproductive age. A growing body of evidence highlights glucose metabolism 
      disorders, including insulin resistance, in the context of PCOS. This study aimed 
      to investigate the association of acne and its severity with insulin resistance 
      in a population of women with PCOS. PATIENTS AND METHODS: A total of 305 women 
      with PCOS aged between 17-35 years were included in this retrospective 
      observational study. Anthropometric, hormonal, biochemical, and ultrasonographic 
      markers of PCOS were analyzed in relation to insulin resistance indices, 
      including HOMA-IR and QUICKI. RESULTS: Acne was present in 56.4% of participants, 
      with 52.1% exhibiting mild and 4.3% severe cases. Younger age (p=0.006), higher 
      DHEAS levels (p=0.001), and glucose metabolism disorders, including fasting 
      glucose >100 mg/dl, p=0.026 and 2-h glucose higher than 140 mg/dl (p=0.019), were 
      significantly associated with acne. Multivariate analysis indicated younger age 
      (OR=0.94, p=0.012), elevated DHEAS levels (OR=1.03; p=0.006), and 2-h glucose 
      levels >140 mg/dl (OR=3.25, p=0.029) as independent predictors of acne severity. 
      CONCLUSION: This study indicates the association between insulin resistance and 
      hyperandrogonemia with both the presence and severity of acne in PCOS. These 
      findings align with contemporary literature and underscore the importance of 
      addressing the hormonal and metabolic factors in the etiological management of 
      acne in PCOS.

      Types.
PG  - 41-48
AB  - OBJECTIVE: This review examined studies published during the past two decades in 
      which lasers were used to treat acne vulgaris. Its aim was to assess the 
      mechanism, efficacy, and safety of lasers as a treatment modality for this 
      vexingly common and potentially disfiguring condition. METHODS: PubMed searches 
      were performed to identify articles published through December 2023 that discuss 
      the use of lasers for the treatment of acne vulgaris. RESULTS: Various lasers, 
      including visible light, infrared, fractional ablative CO(2) lasers with 
      isotretinoin, and two 1726-nm lasers approved by the United States Food and Drug 
      Administration, show efficacy in treating acne vulgaris. Studies vary widely in 
      their design, characteristics, and methodological rigor. LIMITATIONS: The 
      available literature on using lasers to treat acne is limited by variability in 
      study design, short-term follow up, and small sample sizes. CONCLUSION: Lasers 
      have demonstrated efficacy as primary or adjunctive treatment modalities for acne 
      vulgaris in certain clinical scenarios. Larger randomized, controlled, 
      double-blinded studies with sufficiently long follow-up periods and standardized 
      objective measurements are needed to substantiate the efficacy of lasers in 
      treating acne vulgaris.

      Inflammatory Skin Diseases.
LID - 746 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics17060746 [doi]
AB  - Inflammatory skin diseases are highly prevalent conditions characterized by 
      complex immune responses that result in skin tissue damage and pain, 
      significantly impacting patients' physical health. Traditional therapeutic 
      approaches, including oral administration and injections, continue to exhibit 
      inherent limitations. Consequently, there is growing interest in exploring 
      alternative drug delivery systems that offer more effective, targeted, and 
      patient-friendly therapeutic options. Transdermal administration emerges as a 
      promising solution for managing inflammatory skin diseases, facilitating 
      sustained drug release, and reducing the frequency of dosing. This review 
      provides a comprehensive overview of the skin barrier and critically summarizes 
      clinically adopted transdermal drug delivery systems (TDDSs), including 
      sonophoresis, iontophoresis, chemical penetration enhancers, and electroporation. 
      Particular emphasis is placed on emerging advances in microneedle- and 
      nanocarrier-facilitated transdermal delivery strategies. Moreover, the article 
      synthesizes recent fundamental evidence regarding the application of TDDSs in the 
      treatment of atopic dermatitis, psoriasis, and acne. This review examines 
      fundamental research evaluating various transdermal drug delivery systems for the 
      treatment of major inflammatory skin diseases, with an emphasis on their 
      mechanisms of action, advantages, challenges, and future directions. Transdermal 
      drug delivery systems hold the potential to deliver more efficient and safer 
      treatment and management strategies for patients afflicted with inflammatory skin 
      diseases.

TI  - Assessing the Performance of Artificial Intelligence Models in Evaluating 
      Inflammatory Skin Disease Severity: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis.
LID - ljaf250 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/bjd/ljaf250 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVES: Artificial intelligence (AI) applications in 
      dermatology have expanded beyond diagnosis and have shifted towards assessing 
      disease severity. We aim to qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the 
      performance of image-based AI models in severity assessment for various skin 
      diseases. METHODS: In this systematic review and meta-analysis, we collected 
      studies using four electronic databases, including PubMed, Embase, IEEE Xplore, 
      and Web of Science, published from January 1, 2017, to April 6, 2023, and updated 
      the search in November 2023. Studies assessing the performance of deep learning 
      AI models on the severity of skin diseases were included. We excluded studies 
      that utilized a non-validated severity index, lacked clinical images, and 
      assessed wounds, ulcers, or burns. Two independent reviewers extracted 
      prespecified study characteristics for the summary table. For the meta-analysis, 
      contingency tables were extracted, when possible, and re-constructed for each 
      severity measure. Accuracy was calculated using a bivariate model in Metandi 
      package, and meta-regression was performed by disease type and scoring system. 
      This study was registered with PROSPERO, CRD42023487228. RESULTS: Our initial 
      search identified 7737 records. After duplicate removal and abstract screening, 
      we reviewed the full text of 192 articles and included 45 studies for systematic 
      review and 19 for meta-analysis. The pooled sensitivity and specificity of AI 
      models were 80.5% (95% CI 76.2-84.2) and 96.2% (95% CI 94.9-97.2), respectively. 
      Moreover, pooled sensitivity differed by disease (atopic dermatitis 91.8% vs acne 
      80.7%, p=0.005; acne 80.4% vs psoriasis 71.1%, p=0.044) and scoring system (EASI 
      97.3% vs IGA for atopic dermatitis 78.9%, p<0.0001; Hayashi Grading 89.7% vs IGA 
      for acne 69.8%, p<0.0001). CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that current AI models 
      exhibit a high level of capacity in disease severity assessment. Nevertheless, 
      efforts are urgently needed to improve transparency in data reporting and conduct 
      high-quality prospective studies using objective reference standards in clinical 
      settings to generate reliable evidence.

AB  - A study was undertaken to compare the effectiveness and adverse effects of 
      non-insulated microneedle fractional radiofrequency (NIMFRF) and ablative 
      fractional carbon dioxide (AFCO2) laser on facial atrophic acne scarring in a 
      randomized split-face model. Thirty subjects with facial atrophic acne scarring 
      were enrolled. Each side of the face randomly received 1 session of NIMFRF or 
      AFCO2 laser. Photographs were taken by VISIA Complexion Analysis System at 
      baseline, 1 month, 2 months, and 6 months after treatments. Subjective 
      evaluations included Echelle d'Evaluation Clinique des Cicatrices d'Acne (ECCA) 
      score, global improve-ment, and self-satisfaction. Potential adverse effects were 
      also recorded. Skin melanin index and ery-thema index were measured. NIMFRF and 
      AFCO2 laser show-ed comparable efficacies on atrophic acne scarring (p > 0.05). 
      ECCA scores decreased significantly at each follow-up visit, compared with 
      baseline (p < 0.05). Approximate 95% of subjects achieved ""satisfied"" or ""very 
      satisfied"" improvement. Pain was more obvious on the AFCO2 laser side. 
      Significantly increased red area value, melanin index and erythema index levels 
      were seen on the AFCO2 laser side at one month or 2 month, compared with the 
      NIMFRF side (p < 0.05). NIMFRF has milder adverse effects with shorter recovery 
      period than AFCO2 laser. NIMFRF may be preferable for some patients due to its 
      favourable adverse effect profile.

AB  - Cutibacterium acnes (formerly known as Propionibacterium acnes) is a 
      Gram-positive anaerobic bacterium that is frequently found in sebaceous glands 
      and human skin hair follicles. Although it is a normal component of the skin 
      microbiota, acne may result from its overgrowth in specific situations. 
      Andrographis paniculate, a traditional Chinese herb, contains a diterpenoid 
      compound called andrographolide (AGP), which has anti-inflammatory, antibacterial 
      and antioxidant. AGP can strengthen the skin barrier functions by preventing the 
      release of inflammatory factors like TNF-alpha and IL-6. It has also shown that its 
      antibacterial qualities can inhibit pathogens such as Cutibacterium acnes. In 
      this study, through the use of the quantum chemistry approach, we investigated 
      AGP in DMSO and gas phase, in connection to the geometric foundations and energy 
      dynamics by Density Functional Theory (DFT). Furthermore, this work has been 
      carried out on the structural analysis by orbital examination and electrostatic 
      potential (ESP) assessment. Subsequently, we derived the molecular interactions 
      utilizing the independent gradient model within Hirshfeld molecular density 
      partitioning (IGMH). Additionally, the stability and interaction of AGP and 
      fusidic acid with the protein (CA)lipase of Cutibacterium acnes have been 
      investigated by molecular docking and molecular dynamics simulations. This study 
      might provide a fresh perspective for investigating an effective extraction 
      process via methodological analytical discussions.

TI  - The Use of a Fractional Laser in Acne Scar Treatment-A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/life15060915 [doi]
LID - 915
AB  - Background/Objectives: Acne scars are an unwanted reminder of past acne. They 
      constitute a significant esthetic and psychosocial problem, negatively affecting 
      the quality of life of patients. There are many methods used to treat acne scars. 
      One of them is fractional CO(2) laser treatment, which stimulates the skin to 
      produce collagen. The main aim of this study was to verify, based on the 
      available literature, the effectiveness of fractional CO(2) laser treatment of 
      acne scars and to determine the potential risk associated with the use of this 
      therapeutic method. Methods: The literature review includes English-language 
      articles selected using keywords and inclusion and exclusion criteria. In order 
      to select appropriate sources, databases such as PubMed and Google Scholar were 
      searched. Results: The systematic review included seven studies that assessed the 
      effectiveness of fractional CO(2) laser therapy for acne scars. Most patients 
      experienced a 30% to 70% improvement in the appearance of their scars. The most 
      commonly reported adverse events during treatment were transient erythema, edema, 
      and post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation, which resolved within a few weeks. 
      Conclusions: Fractional CO(2) laser therapy is an effective and safe treatment 
      for acne scars. However, despite the abundance of evidence, there is a need for 
      further studies focusing on long-term monitoring of patients.

TI  - Internalized Stigma in Acne Vulgaris Patients and Relationship with Quality of 
      Life, Disease Severity.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare13121359 [doi]
LID - 1359
AB  - Background/Objectives: Acne vulgaris (AV), a common dermatological condition in 
      adolescence, has been widely recognized not only for its physical impact but also 
      for its significant psychological and social consequences, particularly the 
      internalization of stigma. This study specifically aimed to evaluate the state of 
      internalized stigma in adolescents with AV and its relationship with quality of 
      life and disease severity. Additionally, we sought to identify and assess the 
      factors associated with internalized stigma. Methods: A total of 179 patients 
      with AV were included in this cross-sectional observational study. We employed a 
      convenience sampling strategy. The Internalized Stigma Scale (ISS) was used to 
      assess patients' stigma. The Acne Quality of Life Scale (AQLS) and the 
      Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) were used to assess patients' quality of 
      life. The Global Acne Grading System (GAGS) was used to assess disease severity. 
      Results: Cronbach's alpha coefficient for the ISS was determined to be 0.79. In 
      our study, the mean total ISS scores for patients with AV were notably high. The 
      ISS was significantly positively correlated with the AQLS score (r = 0.653, p < 
      0.001), DLQI score (r = 0.487, p < 0.001), and GAGS score (r = 0.257, p = 0.006). 
      Linear regression analysis was performed to predict the ISS variable. 
      Accordingly, the AQLS positively and significantly predicts (beta = 0.521, p < 
      0.001). Conclusions: AVs often experience high levels of stigma. Internalized 
      stigma is strongly associated with reduced quality of life and increased disease 
      severity. Moreover, the AQLS significantly affects stigma.

TI  - Validation of Axial Juvenile Spondyloarthropathy Criteria in Turkish Juvenile 
      Spondyloarthropathy Patients.
LID - 10.3390/diagnostics15121498 [doi]
LID - 1498
AB  - Background: Juvenile spondyloarthritis (JSpA) is a heterogeneous group of 
      diseases. An international consensus group developed the axial juvenile SpA 
      (AxJSpA) classification criteria for this purpose, defining a homogeneous group 
      of patients diagnosed with jSpA and experiencing axial symptoms before the age of 
      18 years. Aim: To validate this new set of criteria in our pediatric SpA 
      patients. Methods: This study was held in the Hacettepe University Department of 
      Pediatric Rheumatology. Juvenile SpA patients suspected of axial disease 
      diagnosed and followed at the same center between 2005 and 2024 were included. 
      Patients who had other etiologies for axial symptoms, including chronic 
      nonbacterial osteomyelitis, mechanical back pain-overuse injuries, amplified 
      pain/growing pains, and SAPHO syndrome (synovitis, acne, pustulosis, 
      hyperostosis, and osteitis) served as the control group. Results: In total, 123 
      JSpA patients and 74 controls were included in this study. The 
      sensitivity/specificity of the new criteria were 61%/77% with an area under curve 
      value of 0.75 (95% CI: 0.68-0.83) in our cohort. Among different criteria sets, 
      European Spondyloarthropathy Study Group (ESSG) criteria were the most sensitive 
      (sensitivity/specificity 91%/68%), and ASAS peripheral criteria (Assessment of 
      SpondyloArthritis International Society) were the most specific 
      (sensitivity/specificity 67%/84%) in our cohort when compared to ASAS axial 
      criteria (sensitivity/specificity 74%/65%), ILAR (International League of 
      Associations for Rheumatology) (sensitivity/specificity 85%/81%), and ILAR + SI 
      (sacroiliitis) (sensitivity/specificity 67%/74%) criteria. Conclusions: The area 
      under the curve of the new AxJSpA criteria was similar to that of the original 
      report; however, both sensitivity and specificity were lower in our cohort, 
      possibly due to factors like earlier disease presentation and a lower prevalence 
      of chronic structural changes on MRI.

TI  - Decoding the Relationship Between Polycystic Ovary Syndrome and Hormonal 
      Dependencies of Anti-Mullerian Hormone and Other Markers.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines13061341 [doi]
LID - 1341
AB  - Background: The objective of this study was to evaluate the influence of 
      polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) on various laboratory measurements, especially 
      hormonal and metabolic parameters, as well as clinical measurements including 
      hirsutism and acne assessment, with consideration of different PCOS phenotypes. 
      This study was focused mainly on the correlation between anti-Mullerian hormone 
      (AMH) levels and other hormonal measurements. Methods: This single-center 
      retrospective study included 296 patients with diagnosed PCOS according to the 
      Rotterdam criteria. All participants of this study underwent blood tests between 
      the 2nd and the 6th day of their menstrual cycle. Results: In statistical 
      analysis, a strong significant correlation of AMH with androstenedione (r = 0.48, 
      p < 0.0001), luteinizing hormone (LH) (r = 0.45, p < 0.0001), total testosterone 
      (r = 0.34, p < 0.0001), 17-hydroxyprogesterone (r = 0.31, p < 0.0001), and 
      cortisol after dexamethasone (r = 0.15, p = 0.011) was observed. In addition, 
      significant negative correlations were found with follicle-stimulating hormone 
      (FSH) (r = -0.21, p < 0.0001), weight (r = -0.15, p = 0.010), glucose 0' (r = 
      -0.14, p = 0.014), hip circumference (r = -0.14, p = 0.017), and body mass index 
      (BMI) (r = -0.14, p = 0.018). A weak correlation with waist circumference of p = 
      0.06 was also observed. Conclusions: AMH serum levels showed a positive 
      correlation with hyperandrogenism and a negative correlation with metabolic 
      factors, although its relationship with BMI is more complex. There were no 
      significant differences in AMH levels across the four PCOS phenotypes or when 
      categorized into hyperandrogenic and normoandrogenic subtypes.

TI  - Acneiform Eruptions Caused by Lithium Treatment May Be Related to Demodex Mites 
      (Prostigmata: Demodecidae): A Hypothesis.
LID - 10.3390/biology14060605 [doi]
LID - 605
AB  - Acneiform eruptions are a common adverse effect of lithium treatment that may 
      impact adherence. It is not clear why lithium may worsen these lesions and 
      treatment has focused on traditional treatments for acne. Demodex mites are known 
      to commensurably exist in a large fraction of humans and are known to cause 
      dermatologic conditions in a minority of individuals. An association with 
      acneiform eruptions is well documented but is generally believed to not be 
      causative. We present a hypothesis that lithium treatment may alter the 
      environment of Demodex mites in a fashion that may increase their propensity to 
      cause disease. If that is accurate, treatment with acaricidal agents may be an 
      additional option.

TI  - Prebiotic Oligosaccharides in Skin Health: Benefits, Mechanisms, and Cosmetic 
      Applications.
LID - 10.3390/antiox14060754 [doi]
LID - 754
AB  - Prebiotic oligosaccharides have attracted significant interest in dermatology and 
      skin health due to their ability to modulate the skin microbiome and 
      microbiota-host interactions. This review offers a novel dual perspective, 
      systematically examining the benefits of both oral intake and topical application 
      of prebiotic oligosaccharides, including well-established prebiotics (e.g., human 
      milk oligosaccharides, galacto- and fructo-oligosaccharides) and emerging 
      prebiotic candidates (e.g., gluco-oligosaccharides, chitosan-oligosaccharides, 
      agaro-oligosaccharides). First, cutting-edge synthetic processes for producing 
      diverse oligosaccharides and their structural chemistry are introduced. Then, we 
      discuss in vitro studies demonstrating their efficacy in promoting skin 
      commensals, inhibiting pathogens, and conferring protective effects, such as 
      antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-melanogenic, and wound-healing properties. 
      Furthermore, we emphasize in vivo animal studies and clinical trials revealing 
      that prebiotic oligosaccharides, administered orally or topically, alleviate 
      atopic dermatitis, enhance skin hydration, attenuate acne, and protect against 
      photo-aging by modulating skin-gut microbiota and immune responses. 
      Mechanistically, we integrate genetic and molecular insights to elucidate how 
      oligosaccharides mediate these benefits, including gut-skin axis crosstalk, 
      immune regulation, and microbial metabolite signaling. Finally, we highlight 
      current commercial applications of oligosaccharides in cosmetic formulations 
      while addressing scientific and practical challenges, such as structure-function 
      relationships, clinical scalability, and regulatory considerations. This review 
      bridges mechanistic understanding with practical applications, offering a 
      comprehensive resource for advancing prebiotic oligosaccharides-based skincare 
      therapies.

TI  - Competencies and clinical guidelines for managing acne with isotretinoin in 
      general practice: A scoping review.
LID - BJGP.2025.0135 [pii]
LID - 10.3399/BJGP.2025.0135 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Acne is a common, chronic and burdensome disease. There is evidence 
      of delayed and inequitable patient access to isotretinoin. Overuse of antibiotics 
      in acne raises antimicrobial stewardship concerns. AIM: Identify clinical 
      practice guideline (CPG) and consensus statement recommendations regarding the 
      clinical competencies required for prescribing oral isotretinoin for acne. DESIGN 
      AND SETTING: Scoping review of acne CPGs and consensus statements, globally. 
      METHOD: The Arksey and O'Malley framework informed design in conjunction with JBI 
      guidance. The PRISMA extension for Scoping Reviews guided reporting. The search 
      was conducted across six databases (Embase, Scopus, Web of Science, PubMed, 
      CINAHL, PsycINFO), three guideline repositories (SIGN, TRIP, GIN) and grey 
      literature. Two researchers independently screened titles and abstracts, and 
      full-text papers. The AGREE II checklist appraised CPG quality. RESULTS: From the 
      initial 2,292 articles, eight CPGs were included after applying inclusion and 
      exclusion criteria. Five were from Europe, with one each from the U.S.A, Canada 
      and Malaysia. The CPG guidance varied regarding ""which doctor may prescribe 
      isotretinoin?"" All CPGs indicated dermatologists, and four identified GPs as 
      appropriate prescribers. The CPGs identify the clinical competencies to safely 
      manage people with acne using isotretinoin: dermatology, pregnancy prevention, 
      mental health assessment and blood testing. CONCLUSION: This scoping review has 
      identified the key clinical competencies that underpin safe management of people 
      with acne using isotretinoin: dermatology, pregnancy prevention, mental health 
      assessment and blood testing. Resourcing and supporting GPs to incrementally 
      adopt this role may promote safe, timely and equitable patient access to 
      isotretinoin, while enhancing antimicrobial stewardship.

TI  - Artificial Intelligence in the Assessment and Grading of Acne Vulgaris: A 
      Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/jpm15060238 [doi]
LID - 238
AB  - Acne vulgaris is a common dermatological condition, particularly affecting 
      adolescents during critical developmental stages, which may have lasting 
      psychosocial impacts. Traditional assessments, including global severity grading 
      and lesion counting, are limited by subjectivity and time constraints. 
      Background/Objectives: This review aims to systematically assess the recent 
      advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) applications for acne diagnosis, 
      lesion segmentation/counting, and severity grading, highlighting the potential of 
      AI-driven methods to improve objectivity, reproducibility, and clinical 
      efficiency. Methods: A comprehensive literature search was conducted across 
      PubMed, Scopus, arXiv, Embase, and Web of Science for studies published between 1 
      January 2017 and 1 March 2025. The search strategy incorporated terms related to 
      ""acne"" and various AI methodologies (e.g., ""neural network"", ""deep learning"", 
      ""convolutional neural network""). Two independent reviewers screened 345 articles, 
      with 29 studies ultimately meeting inclusion criteria. Data were extracted on 
      study design, dataset characteristics (including internal and publicly available 
      resources such as ACNE04 and AcneSCU), AI architectures (predominantly CNN-based 
      models), and performance metrics. Results: While AI-driven models demonstrated 
      promising accuracy, as high as 97.6% in controlled settings, the limited 
      availability of large public datasets, the predominance of data from specific 
      ethnic groups, and the lack of extensive external validation underscore critical 
      barriers to clinical implementation. Conclusions: The findings indicate that 
      although AI has the potential to standardize acne assessments, reduce observer 
      variability, and enable self-monitoring via mobile platforms, significant 
      challenges remain in achieving robust, real-world applicability. Future research 
      should prioritize the development of large, diverse, and publicly accessible 
      datasets and undertake prospective clinical validations to ensure equitable and 
      effective dermatological care.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Indigenous communities in Canada face significant dermatological 
      health care disparities due to systemic barriers, geographic isolation, and 
      limited access to specialists. These challenges are further exacerbated by 
      numerous socio-economic factors. Addressing these issues requires policy reforms, 
      Indigenous-led health care initiatives, and the recognition of traditional 
      natural-based remedies as valuable contributors to improve health outcomes, 
      mutual trust, and patient compliance. METHODOLOGY: A detailed literature review 
      was conducted using PubMed and the Native American Ethnobotany Database, aiming 
      to identify traditional remedies focusing on plants and natural resources used by 
      Indigenous/First Nations communities for the treatment of dermatological 
      conditions and skin wellness. The focus was on plant-based and natural resources 
      traditionally used by the Cree, Inuit, Algonquin, and Iroquois, as documented in 
      ethnobotanical and medical literature. RESULTS: A total of 73 distinct plant 
      species used for various dermatological conditions were identified from 64 
      articles. These findings were categorized into 8 groups based on the specific 
      skin conditions they addressed: psoriasis/papulosquamous-related conditions, 
      acne, infections affecting the skin and soft tissues, pruritic disorders, 
      cosmetic and aesthetic applications, warts, hair and nail conditions, and other 
      dermatological applications. Many of these treatments possess antimicrobial and 
      anti-inflammatory properties, highlighting their potential for integration into 
      modern skincare and therapeutic innovations. CONCLUSION: For generations, 
      Indigenous communities have relied on traditional plant-based remedies for 
      dermatological care, emphasizing a holistic approach to well-being. Integrating 
      these practices with Western dermatology can foster trust, improve patient 
      outcomes, and uphold cultural values.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Psychodermatologic conditions include primary psychodermatologic 
      disorders (PPDs), psychological conditions manifesting with dermatologic 
      symptoms, and psychophysiological disorders, dermatologic conditions influenced 
      by psychological stress. Despite their clinical significance and considerable 
      impact on quality of life, the comprehensive epidemiology and neuropsychiatric 
      comorbidity profiles of these disorders remain limited. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate 
      the prevalence and comorbidity profiles of psychodermatologic conditions in a 
      diverse, population-based cohort. METHODS: A nested, case-control study was 
      conducted using data from the All of us research program. From 287,011 eligible 
      participants, 984 patients with PPDs (trichotillomania, skin picking disorder, 
      dermatitis artefacta, body dysmorphic disorder, delusions of parasitosis) and 
      40,535 patients with psychophysiological disorders (psoriasis, atopic dermatitis, 
      acne vulgaris, hidradenitis suppurativa, vulvodynia) were identified using 
      International Classification of Diseases, 10th Revision, Clinical Modification 
      codes. Each patient was paired with 4 controls based on age, sex, and 
      race/ethnicity using nearest-neighbor propensity score matching. Multivariable 
      logistic regression calculated adjusted odds ratios (aOR) and 95% confidence 
      intervals to evaluate associations with various neuropsychiatric comorbidities. 
      RESULTS: PPDs showed low point prevalences (range: </=0.01-0.17%) but demonstrated 
      markedly higher odds of neuropsychiatric comorbidities, including depressive 
      disorders (range: aOR, 5.72-13.94), anxiety disorders (range: aOR, 5.96-8.40), 
      and personality disorders (range: aOR, 8.67-13.56 Psychophysiological disorders 
      had higher prevalence rates (range: 0.14%-5.72%) but showed more moderate 
      associations, including depressive disorders (range: aOR, 2.24-3.13), 
      neurodevelopmental disorders (range: aOR, 1.20-2.36), and sleep-wake disorders 
      (range: aOR, 2.25-3.95). CONCLUSIONS: Findings reveal distinct but overlapping 
      comorbidity profiles between PPDs and psychophysiological disorders, emphasizing 
      the need for tailored interventions that address the psychosocial and biological 
      complexities of these conditions.

AB  - Clascoterone is an androgen receptor inhibitor approved for the treatment of acne 
      vulgaris in patients 12 years of age and older. Here, we report results of 5 
      phase 1 studies that assessed the pharmacokinetics (PK), safety, and skin 
      irritation and sensitization potential of clascoterone cream 1% in healthy 
      participants and patients with acne. Studies CB-03-01/02 (EudraCT: 
      2007-005064-28) and CB-03-01/04 (n = 24 each) assessed PK in healthy 
      participants. Study 171-7151-203 (n = 8) assessed steady-state PK in patients 
      with acne. Studies CB-03-01/05 (n = 36) and CB-03-01/32 (n = 250) assessed skin 
      irritation and sensitization potential, respectively, in healthy participants. 
      Systemic exposure to clascoterone was low after repeated daily application for up 
      to 42 days of treatment. Clascoterone was excreted in urine as conjugated esters 
      at a </=1% fraction of the administered dose. Adverse events and local skin 
      reactions were generally mild/moderate and reversible. No clinically relevant 
      changes were observed in laboratory tests and vital signs. Skin irritation and 
      sensitization with clascoterone treatment were minimal. Phase 1 study findings 
      supported low systemic absorption of clascoterone and a favorable safety profile 
      after topical application of clascoterone cream 1%, with no evidence of 
      irritation or sensitization.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Skin microecology significantly affects health, with the microbiome 
      being a complex community of microorganisms. Different niche preferences of 
      microorganisms raise concerns about the adequacy of common sampling methods like 
      swabbing and cyanoacrylate biopsy. In this study, we aim to contribute to a more 
      suitable sampling strategy in acne microbiome studies. METHODS: This study 
      involved ten mild to moderate acne patients. Three sampling methods were used: 
      swab sampling (S1), modified standardized skin surface biopsy (S2), and 
      individual comedo extraction (S3). DNA was extracted and sequenced to analyze the 
      microbiome data. RESULTS: There were significant differences in the bacterial and 
      fungal microbiome data obtained by the three different sampling methods. 
      Staphylococcus spp. (significantly higher in S3, P<0.05) and Malassezia spp. 
      (higher in S3, P<0.05) were most affected by sampling methods. Bacterial phyla 
      Proteobacteria (abundant in S1) and Bacteroidota (dominant in S2) also showed 
      method-dependent variations. CONCLUSION: The choice of sampling method 
      significantly impacts microbiome data, highlighting the need for accurate 
      sampling to understand the relationship between the skin microbiome and acne. 
      Standardizing sampling methods in future studies is essential for advancing skin 
      microecology research. CLINICAL TRIAL REGISTRATION: http://www.chictr.org.cn,

AB  - The gold standard of acne vulgaris management remains a stepwise and combination 
      approach with topical and systemic medications. However, it is not uncommon for 
      patients to experience intermittent flares or inadequate control despite 
      optimized medical management. Other patients may experience side effects that 
      limit their ability to comply with these medications or desire to avoid systemic 
      medications altogether. In order to optimize acne control, light and laser-based 
      devices (LLBD) are gaining popularity due to their efficacy and durable results. 
      In this review, we explore the principles of visible light therapy, photodynamic 
      therapy, photopneumatic therapy, intense pulsed light, pulse dye laser, potassium 
      titanyl phosphate lasers, infrared lasers, and the novel 1726nm fiber-coupled 
      diode lasers in the treatment of acne vulgaris.

AB  - Recent years have seen an increase in the incidence of acne in adults and 
      teenagers resulting in active research in acne treatment. In the present study, 
      we aimed to improve the anti-acne effects of Hwangryeonhaedok-tang (HHT) through 
      fermentation using a kimchi-derived lactic acid bacterium. Lactiplantibacillus 
      plantarum WiKim0111 (Lpb. plantarum WiKim0111) was selected to ferment HHT due to 
      its strong antioxidant activity and its ability to effectively survive and grow 
      in the HHT medium. The antimicrobial activity of HHT and fermented HHT (FHHT) 
      against Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) was determined using an agar well 
      diffusion assay. FHHT exhibited stronger antimicrobial, radical scavenging, and 
      superoxide dismutase activity compared to HHT. RAW 264.7 cells pretreated HHT or 
      FHHT showed significantly lower production of nitric oxide, interleukin (IL) -1beta, 
      and IL-6 than lipopolysaccharide -treated cells, with FHHT demonstrating higher 
      efficiency than HHT. Overall, HHT fermented by Lpb. plantarum WiKim0111 displayed 
      enhanced antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties, as well as greater 
      antibacterial activity against C. acnes compared to unfermented HHT. These 
      findings suggest that FHHT may help mitigate acne symptoms by reducing oxidative 
      stress, modulating inflammation, and directly inhibiting the growth of C. acnes. 
      Further in vitro studies focusing on sebum-producing skin cells, as well as 
      clinical trials evaluating the topical or oral application of FHHT, would be 
      valuable to confirm its efficacy and safety in acne treatment.

TI  - [Contraception and acne].
PG  - 279-285
AB  - CONTRACEPTION AND ACNE. Acne is one of the most common disorders of young women 
      during their genital activity. Although its pathophysiology is complex, acne 
      seems to be partly linked to increased sensitivity to androgens. Hormonal 
      contraception (estrogen-progestin or progestin-only) has therefore a positive or 
      negative impact on acne, which varies according to the type of estrogen/progestin 
      molecule or combination used. The management of acne is well codified according 
      to its grade in the 2015 Societe francaise de dermatologie (SFD) recommendations. 
      Nevertheless, it's important to remember that hormonal contraception alone is not 
      part of acne therapy. On the other hand, in the case of acne-prone women wishing 
      to use contraception, combined oral contraceptives with a low venous 
      thromboembolic risk should be preferred, as should those containing an 
      anti-androgenic progestogen, particularly norgestimate, which meets both 
      requirements.

TI  - Epidemiology of Skin Diseases in Poland: Analysis of Prevalence and Risk Factors: 
      A Cross-Sectional Study.
LID - 10.1007/s13555-025-01464-5 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Although skin diseases are a significant public health concern, 
      epidemiological data for Poland is still lacking. This study aimed to fill this 
      scientific gap by analyzing the prevalence of skin diseases and associated risk 
      factors in the Polish population. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was conducted 
      using data from the National Healthy Skin Test (2023), an online questionnaire 
      distributed via the Medonet health platform, involving 27,000 adult Polish 
      internet users. Participants self-reported physician-diagnosed skin conditions. 
      The prevalence of these conditions was assessed, and statistical analysis, 
      including logistic regression, was used to evaluate associations with demographic 
      and socioeconomic factors (age, gender, education level, and urbanization). 
      RESULTS: The most prevalent skin conditions were herpes labialis (40.6%), 
      dandruff (37.6%), hair loss (34.8%), and acne (32.7%), with 89.5% of participants 
      reporting at least one condition. Striking gender differences were observed, with 
      psoriasis (odds ratio [OR] = 2.10, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.80-2.30) and 
      tinea pedis (OR = 2.10, 95% CI: 1.90-2.30) in men, while women were more prone to 
      rosacea (OR = 0.6, 95% CI: 0.50-0.70) and hair loss (OR = 0.70, 95% CI: 
      0.60-0.70). Higher education was unexpectedly associated with an increased risk 
      of multiple conditions, including acne (OR = 1.50, 95% CI: 1.40-1.60) and 
      non-melanoma skin cancer (OR = 1.40, 95% CI: 1.20-1.80), but a decreased risk of 
      psoriasis (OR = 0.90, 95% CI: 0.80-1.00). Urban residents of cities 
      with > 500,000 inhabitants showed a significantly higher prevalence of atopic 
      dermatitis/eczema (OR = 1.20, 95% CI: 1.00-1.30) and non-melanoma skin cancer 
      (OR = 2.00, 95% CI: 1.40-2.90) compared with other areas. CONCLUSIONS: This first 
      overview of skin disease epidemiology in Poland reveals significant variations in 
      prevalence based on demographic and socioeconomic factors. These findings have 
      important public health implications, suggesting the need for: (1) 
      gender-specific dermatological education campaigns, (2) age-targeted skin cancer 
      screening programs for those over 65 years, (3) improved access to dermatological 
      care in rural areas, and (4) educational interventions addressing the observed 
      socioeconomic disparities in disease prevalence and detection.

LID - 10.1177/12034754241308237 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Recent years have seen a surge in the use of artificial intelligence 
      (AI) in healthcare, including dermatology. This scoping review aimed to assess 
      the emerging applications of AI use in the context of chronic, non-neoplastic 
      dermatologic diseases. METHODS: MEDLINE, Embase, PubMed and SCOPUS were searched 
      on August 11, 2023 using variations of the search concepts ""dermatology,"" 
      ""artificial intelligence,"" and 12 common chronic dermatologic conditions. Article 
      screening and data extraction were completed, and each study was categorized into 
      themes and conditions. RESULTS: A total of 224 unique studies were included. The 
      most prevalent conditions that were studied in the context of AI included 
      psoriasis (n = 67), atopic dermatitis/eczema (n = 41) and acne (n = 36). The 
      majority of AI applications involved clinical evaluation (n = 176), images 
      (analysis, generation or segmentation) (n = 163) and data analysis (n = 46). 
      Clinical evaluation was further divided into 2 subthemes: diagnosis (n = 104) and 
      disease assessment (n = 67). Diagnostic and analytic applications of AI are 
      limited by the training datasets available (quantity of training data, image 
      quality) and insufficient diagnostic information provided (eg, the patient's 
      reported history of their lesion, disease/symptom onset and risk factors). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Common applications of AI are predominantly as an automated 
      diagnostic tool for evaluating disease severity/characteristics, while niche and 
      novel applications were explored further. However, recognizing the limitations of 
      technology is critical prior to the widespread application of AI in 
      dermatological practice. The insights from the current study can inform clinical 
      adoption of AI in dermatology, and highlight research gaps to guide future 
      academic initiatives.

TI  - Management of Hidradenitis Suppurativa in Special Populations: A Narrative 
      Review.
LID - 10.1007/s13555-025-01457-4 [doi]
AB  - Hidradenitis suppurativa (HS) is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that can be 
      treated with a variety of medical and surgical therapies. However, these 
      therapies carry inherent risks that might be heightened in medically complex 
      patients. This narrative review examines literature for the nuances of standard 
      HS management in immunosuppressed individuals, patients with cancer, and those 
      with gastrointestinal or cardiovascular comorbidities, Down syndrome, and PASH 
      syndrome, a rare condition that is characterized by the presence of pyoderma 
      gangrenosum (PG), acne, and HS. The treatment of HS often requires systemic 
      immunomodulators, and their use necessitates a careful risk-benefit analysis to 
      balance disease control and infection risk in patients who are immunosuppressed. 
      Owing to chronic inflammation, HS is associated with an increased risk of 
      malignancies such as cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma. Vigilant screening and 
      histopathologic evaluation of chronic HS lesions are required for chronic lesions 
      and patients with concurrent cancer. There is a high prevalence of inflammatory 
      bowel disease (IBD) in patients with HS, and this can present unique challenges 
      in management. For example, some biologic therapies commonly used for HS can 
      exacerbate IBD symptoms. Cardiovascular disease is a common comorbidity in HS and 
      demands a multidisciplinary approach to risk assessment and treatment, 
      particularly given the systemic inflammatory burden of HS. Patients with Down 
      syndrome are disproportionately affected by HS and often receive suboptimal 
      treatment, underscoring the need for improved screening and access to therapies. 
      PASH and other related syndromes are rare variants of HS and can be a challenge 
      to manage owing to their unpredictable response to tumor necrosis factor-alpha 
      (TNF-alpha) and interleukin-1 (IL-1) inhibitors. Across these unique populations, 
      surgical intervention continues to be a viable option in refractory cases, even 
      with the risk of impaired wound healing in patients who are immunosuppressed and 
      have cancer. Ultimately, a comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach is essential 
      to optimize HS management in these special populations, integrating surgical and 
      systemic therapies while mitigating associated risks.

TI  - Safety Evaluation of Topical Products Containing Live Cultures and Ferment of 
      Cutibacterium Acnes Subspecies Defendens Strain XYCM42 in Individuals Predisposed 
      to Acne Vulgaris.
PG  - 44-53
AB  - BACKGROUND: For individuals with acne-prone skin, identifying a topical regimen 
      that does not lead to progression of their inflammatory issues often poses a 
      challenge. A topical skin probiotic regimen containing a specific strain of 
      Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) subspecies defendens, XYCM42, has been shown to be 
      beneficial in improving skin health and appearance in individuals with generally 
      healthy skin, but the use of the skin probiotic has not been sufficiently 
      assessed in individuals with acne-prone skin. OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this 
      study was to evaluate the safety and efficacy of daily application of a topical 
      skin biome care regimen containing a living C. acnes subsp. defendens derivative 
      strain, XYCM42, its ferment, and adjunct topicals in individuals with acne-prone 
      skin. METHODS: This eight-week study was conducted at five locations and included 
      136 total participants. At baseline, Week 1, Week 4, and Week 8, subjects 
      completed product questionnaires and symptom severity surveys. Of the study 
      subjects, 20 were enrolled for clinical efficacy evaluation at all timepoints. 
      Clinical assessments included blemish lesion counts, Investigator's Global 
      Assessment (IGA) of acne lesion severity, and clinical grading of skin cosmetic 
      and safety parameters. RESULTS: As early as Week 1 of regimen application, 
      clinical observations demonstrated statistically significant improvements in acne 
      severity scores, with no subjects reporting increased or worsened acne during the 
      study. By Week 4, subjects showed significant changes in nearly all skin cosmetic 
      parameters assessed, including skin texture, clarity, tone, fine wrinkling, 
      undereye dark circles, dryness, and erythema. Lesion counts were significantly 
      reduced from baseline at all timepoints, with 100 percent of subjects 
      experiencing fewer non-inflammatory lesions and 70 percent and 30 percent with 
      fewer papule and pustule inflammatory lesions, respectively, by the end of the 
      study. No adverse events were reported. CONCLUSION: This at-home use study 
      demonstrates that use of the XYCM42-based topical skin biome care regimen is both 
      safe and appropriate for individuals with acne-prone skin. More broadly, the 
      outcomes of this study provide further support toward the beneficial and 
      commensal nature of C. acnes subsp. defendens in promoting skin health.

TI  - Violet photobiomodulation: biological effects and health implications.
PG  - 292
LID - 10.1007/s10103-025-04550-4 [doi]
AB  - Photobiomodulation (PBM), presents a viable therapeutic modality for a range of 
      medical conditions, leveraging specific wavelengths to target various clinical 
      outcomes. Despite its potential, significant variability in dosimetric 
      parameters, application methods, and treatment protocols persists across the 
      literature, complicating standardization and efficacy assessment. This review 
      aims to consolidate current findings on the effects of Violet light PBM, to 
      inform clinical practice, identify inconsistencies, and highlight areas 
      necessitating further investigation. We systematically searched several 
      databases, including the Directory of Open Access Journals, EMBASE, MEDLINE, 
      PubMed, Lilacs, Periodicos Capes, and Scielo in January 2024, applying rigorous 
      selection criteria to identify relevant studies. From this search, 51 studies met 
      the inclusion criteria and were subjected to a qualitative synthesis. Violet 
      light PBM has shown notable efficacy in microbial eradication and holds promise 
      for applications such as wound healing, neurogenesis, myopia correction, acne 
      treatment, and vasodilation. The findings from this review underscore the 
      therapeutic potential of Violet light PBM across various medical applications. 
      However, the existing body of research, predominantly composed of in vitro 
      studies, highlights the necessity for more robust pre-clinical and clinical 
      investigations to establish standardized protocols and ensure consistent, 
      reliable outcomes in clinical settings. Further research will be pivotal in 
      bridging the gap between experimental results and practical, evidence-based 
      medical interventions.

TI  - Antibiotic resistance rates in Cutibacterium acnes isolated from patients with 
      acne vulgaris: a systematic review and meta-analysis.
PG  - 1565111
LID - 10.3389/fmicb.2025.1565111 [doi]
LID - 1565111
AB  - BACKGROUND: Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) is closely related to the pathogenesis 
      of acne, and studies related to the antibiotic resistance rates of C. acnes have 
      been reported worldwide; however, relevant systematic reviews and meta-analyses 
      are still lacking. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the 
      resistance in C. acnes to relevant antibiotics, that this information may be used 
      to provide a rational basis for the antibiotic treatment of acne. METHODS: 
      Relevant studies in PubMed, the Cochrane Library, EMBASE, Web of Science, China 
      National Knowledge Infrastructure (CNKI) and Wanfang Data were systematically 
      searched from January 1, 2005, to April 1, 2025, and the resistance rates of C. 
      acnes isolates to quinolones, macrolides, tetracyclines, and other relevant 
      antibiotics were collected. The combined resistance rate was calculated via the R 
      language program package 4.3.2, with subgroup analyses based on different years, 
      continents, countries, provinces in China and different drug susceptibility 
      testing methods. RESULTS: A total of 8,846 studies were systematically retrieved 
      and 23 studies were included, corresponding to 2,046 isolates of C. acnes, which 
      have shown antibiotic resistance rates ranging from high to low: 48.17% (95% CI: 
      41.16-55.24%) for roxithromycin, 45.64% (95% CI: 20.49-73.22%) for 
      clarithromycin, 43.33% (95% CI: 27.81-60.29%) for azithromycin, 29.20% (95% CI: 
      22.14-37.43%) for erythromycin, 22.38% (95% CI: 14.69-32.56%) for clindamycin, 
      5.93% (95% CI: 2.91-11.69%) for levofloxacin, 2.44% (95% CI: 0.99-5.89%) for 
      doxycycline, 1.47% (95% CI: 0.00-85.72%) for trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole 
      (TMP-SMX), 1.31% (95% CI: 0.45-3.70%) for tetracycline, 0.28% (95% CI: 
      0.04-1.94%) for chloramphenicol, 0.22% (95% CI: 0.03-1.89%) for minocycline. 
      Subgroup analysis revealed that, compared with those in other regions, the 
      resistance rates to macrolides and clindamycin were higher in China. In addition, 
      the levofloxacin, erythromycin, and clindamycin resistance rates were 
      progressively increasing over time. CONCLUSION: In certain regions, the 
      relatively high antibiotic resistance rates (e.g., 77% (95% CI: 62-87%) for 
      clarithromycin in China) in C. acnes isolates may be attributed to the overuse of 
      antibiotics in acne treatment. The resistance rates in C. acnes to tetracyclines, 
      such as 2.44% (95% CI: 0.99-5.89%) for doxycycline, remain relatively low, which 
      allows tetracyclines to continue serving as first-line antibiotics for acne 
      treatment. In addition, the resistance rates to levofloxacin, erythromycin, and 
      clindamycin markedly increased over time (p < 0.05). This emphasizes the 
      significance of rational use of the antibiotics in acne treatment.

AB  - Hidradenitis suppurativa has emerged from therapeutic obscurity only in the last 
      few years. Initially, the purulent and infectious nature of the lesions naturally 
      lead to first-line treatment with antibiotics, some of which are indeed highly 
      effective, particularly for moderate forms, or when used to overcome a highly 
      inflammatory acute flare. Subsequent advances in physiopathology have emphasised 
      the significant value of immunomodulatory therapies, mainly via the blockade of 
      the TNF-alpha and IL-17 cytokine pathways. Modulation of these nonspecific immune and 
      inflammatory signalling pathways is thus becoming increasingly important in 
      numerous on-going therapeutic trials: JAK pathway and complement inhibition, IL-1 
      blockade, and even inhibition of B-lymphocyte activation pathways. In this 
      article we detail the currently available data and drugs, and their indications 
      in relation to disease stage, while being constantly aware that presently optimal 
      results require multidisciplinary collaboration and often the use of combination 
      therapies.

TI  - A cross-sectional survey of experiences and outcomes of using testosterone 
      replacement therapy in UK men.
PG  - 1295-1307
LID - 10.21037/tau-2024-738 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Prevalence of late-onset testosterone deficiency (TD) ranges between 
      6-30% depending on diagnostic criteria. Recent data highlights various benefits 
      of testosterone replacement therapy (TRT), including increased libido, mood, bone 
      mineral density, and lean body mass. This study investigated the personal 
      experiences of men with TD around low testosterone and TRT, including barriers to 
      accessing TRT. METHODS: Previous or current TRT users were recruited via email 
      from private clinics' emailing lists, professional medical organisations and 
      researchers' professional networks. Participants completed a 52-item structured 
      questionnaire on Qualtrics XM, exploring their perceptions and experiences of TRT 
      on their symptoms and quality of life. Associations between demographics, 
      duration of symptoms and effectiveness were assessed using logistic regressions. 
      RESULTS: Among the 905 men on TD treatment, 86% delayed treatment for at least a 
      year, including 24% who experienced symptoms for over 5 years before seeking 
      care. Older men (aged 51+ years) were 1.61 times more likely to delay treatment. 
      The majority (85%) reported TRT as effective or very effective, with longer-term 
      users 2.6 times more likely to report TRT as very effective compared to recent 
      starters. Primary motivations for seeking TRT included improving personal 
      relationships (79%) and physical appearance (53%). Most (81%) relied on online 
      sources for information; fewer (18%) felt comfortable discussing hormonal health 
      with their peers. Patient expectations during medical consultations focused on 
      diagnosis (77%), treatment options (64%) and learning about potential side 
      effects (51%). The most common side effects were acne (24%), testicular shrinkage 
      (24%) and nipple itchiness/gynaecomastia (19%). TRT users reported notable 
      improvements in overall quality of life (75%), mental wellbeing (71%), 
      self-esteem and self-confidence (69%) and appearance (61%). CONCLUSIONS: A 
      significant proportion of men aged over 50 years surveyed reported experiencing 
      prolonged symptoms of TD prior to seeking care. There is a need for greater 
      awareness and education regarding TD symptoms, including streamlining timely and 
      equitable access to effective treatment options.

      Dermatological Diseases.
PG  - 1-7

AB  - Background: Skin-related health problems constitute a considerable portion of the 
      reasons for consulting a family physician. Therefore, family physicians play a 
      key role as gatekeepers in evaluating the signs and symptoms of various skin 
      diseases, triaging the patients, and deciding upon the necessity for referral. 
      The aim was to investigate the most common dermatological diseases encountered by 
      family physicians in the outpatient clinics and determine the diagnostic and 
      remedial approach of family physicians to these skin diseases in Turkiye. 
      Methods: An online questionnaire composed of 48 questions related to the 
      demographic and educational information of the participants, the most frequently 
      seen dermatoses in outpatient settings, and the management skills of the 
      participants for various skin disorders, was created using Google Forms. Via 
      instant messaging and e-mail, the survey was distributed among practitioner 
      family physicians, family physician residents, and family medicine specialists 
      who were actively employed in different healthcare facilities in Turkiye. The 
      snowball sampling method was used to convey the survey. Results: The present 
      questionnaire-based study was conducted between October 2024 and January 2025. A 
      total number of 176 participants who were actively working in different 
      healthcare facilities in Turkiye were included in the study. The median number of 
      patients examined in a month was 1025 (range: 90-4000). The most commonly 
      encountered cutaneous diseases were fungal infections of the hair, nail, skin, 
      and mucous membranes (91.5%) followed by scabies (80.1%), acne vulgaris (72.2%), 
      and herpes simplex infection (65.9%). Herpes simplex infections, fungal 
      infections of the skin, hair, nails, mucosa, and scabies were the 3 leading skin 
      diseases at which family physicians felt competent while administering treatment. 
      Conclusion: The results of the current study point out that since family 
      physicians deal with a relatively high rate of skin disorders in their daily 
      practice, it is quite essential to reinforce their diagnostic and therapeutic 
      proficiencies through intensified dermatology courses and rotations.

AB  - The link between skin microbiota and acne, despite being a research focus for 
      years, still lacks full understanding and remains controversial. The genome-wide 
      association studies data utilized in this study were all sourced from public 
      databases. Microbiota data from sebaceous (acne-prone) skin regions were selected 
      for bidirectional Mendelian randomization analysis with acne. The primary method 
      utilized was the inverse-variance weighted (IVW) method, supported by 
      heterogeneity analysis, horizontal pleiotropy testing, outlier detection, and 
      ""leave-one-out"" sensitivity analysis. This Mendelian randomization analysis 
      revealed causal connections between the abundance of the genus: staphylococcus 
      (IVW odds ratio [OR]: 1.074; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.031-1.119, P = .001) 
      and Propionibacterium acnes (IVW OR = 1.039, 95% CI = 1.007-1.073, P = .017) in 
      sebaceous skin and the risk of acne development. Additionally, ASV004 
      (Corynebacterium [unclassified]) (IVW OR = 0.967, 95% CI = 0.937-0.999, P = .044) 
      and ASV008 (Staphylococcus [unclassified]) (IVW OR = 0.943, 95% CI = 0.897-0.991, 
      P = .021) were identified as protective factors that could reduce acne incidence. 
      No reverse causality between skin microbiota and acne was found, with all 
      analyses showing no horizontal pleiotropy or heterogeneity. This study is 
      instrumental in exploring the link between skin microbiota and acne, supporting 
      theoretical debates, and shedding light on acne's pathogenesis.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Despite the high prevalence of acne vulgaris and its impact on 
      affected individuals, few studies have provided a detailed characterization of 
      acne phenotypes and their associated risk factors. This study aims to 
      comprehensively evaluate the prevalence, severity, scarring, and phenotypes of 
      acne, along with their associated risk factors, in a cohort of young Chinese 
      adults, as part of the Singapore and Malaysia Cross-Sectional Genetic 
      Epidemiology Study (SMCGES). METHODS: Participants were randomly and 
      consecutively recruited from universities in Singapore and Malaysia. Data on 
      sociodemographic, familial medical histories of atopic diseases and acne, and 
      lifestyle habits were collected using a validated investigator-administered 
      questionnaire from 6225 young Chinese adults (mean age = 22.8 +/- 5.7 years). A 
      subset of participants underwent clinical assessment for acne severity (n = 
      2345), scarring grade (n = 2345), and phenotypes (n = 1191) by dermatologically 
      trained personnel. RESULTS: The prevalence of acne was 56.0%. Among acne cases (n 
      = 3504), 38.5% had moderate-severe acne, 52.8% had scarring, 95.7% presented with 
      blackhead and/or whitehead, and 55.8% had inflammatory phenotypes (e.g., papules, 
      pustules, cysts and nodules). A parental history of acne emerged as the strongest 
      risk factor associated with all acne phenotypes. Pet ownership (Adjusted odds 
      ratio [AOR]: 1.403, 95% Confidence level [CI]: 1.131-1.744, p < 0.05) and 
      occasional alcohol consumption (AOR: 1.328, 95% CI: 1.090-1.617, p < 0.05) were 
      associated with a higher odd for blackhead and/or whitehead. Protective factors 
      included higher parental education levels for acne scarring (AOR: 0.650, 95% CI: 
      0.459-0.904; p < 0.05), male gender (AOR: 0.365, 95% CI: 0.298-0.446; p < 0.05) 
      and birthplace (AOR: 0.674, 95% CI: 0.555-0.819; p < 0.05) for non-inflammatory 
      phenotypes. CONCLUSIONS: This study, conducted in a well-defined cohort of young 
      Chinese adults from the SMCGES, reinforces familial history as a key risk factor 
      for acne onset, severity, scarring, and phenotype manifestation. The 
      identification of modifiable and environmental factors associated with acne 
      phenotypes offers valuable insights for targeted interventions to improve acne 
      management and control.

TI  - Fetomaternal Outcome in Women With Gestational Diabetes Mellitus With and Without 
      Polycystic Ovary Syndrome: A Comparative Approach.
PG  - e84256

AB  - Background Gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) is an increasing health concern 
      during pregnancy, associated with various maternal and fetal complications, such 
      as pre-eclampsia, polyhydramnios, fetal macrosomia, birth trauma, neonatal 
      metabolic complications, and prenatal death. Polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is 
      characterized by symptoms like amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea, hirsutism, obesity, 
      infertility, anovulation, and acne. This paper compares the fetomaternal outcomes 
      in patients with both PCOS and GDM and those with GDM alone. Aim The aim of this 
      paper is to compare the fetomaternal outcomes in patients with both PCOS and GDM 
      with those having GDM alone. By identifying differences in outcomes, the study 
      could help develop guidelines for early interventions and precautionary measures 
      for women with PCOS before conception. This approach could reduce pregnancy 
      complications and mitigate long-term metabolic risks for both the mother and the 
      child. Furthermore, the paper emphasizes the need to develop predictive 
      algorithms based on risk factors to prevent adverse outcomes for both mothers and 
      neonates. Materials and methods This prospective cohort study included 88 
      singleton pregnancies with a known diagnosis of GDM, including those with PCOS 
      diagnosed according to the Rotterdam criteria. Participants were women aged 18 
      years and older, with a gestational age between 5 and 40 weeks. The participants 
      were divided into two groups: GDM with PCOS (Group A) and GDM without PCOS (Group 
      B). At the first visit, patients were initially screened using the DIPSI 
      criteria, which involves a non-fasting 75g glucose challenge test. Patients with 
      a two-hour plasma glucose level of 140 mg/dL or above were identified as 
      positive. Subsequently, these patients underwent a standard oral glucose 
      tolerance test for further evaluation and confirmation of glucose intolerance. 
      Women were followed until delivery. Various parameters were studied, including 
      Doppler changes, polyhydramnios/oligohydramnios, gestational age, mode of 
      delivery, onset of labor (spontaneous/induced), fetal growth restriction or 
      macrosomia, shoulder dystocia, and puerperal complications such as postpartum 
      hemorrhage, lactation failure, and breast abscess. Statistical analysis was 
      performed using IBM SPSS Statistics for Windows, Version 20 (Released 2011; IBM 
      Corp., Armonk, New York, United States). Continuous variables were expressed as 
      mean +/- SD, and categorical variables were represented as percentages. A two-sided 
      P-value of less than 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Conclusion 
      The study concluded that the patients in the GDM with PCOS group did not have 
      poorer fetomaternal outcomes compared to those with GDM alone. Therefore, while 
      certain factors like maternal weight gain and family history of diabetes differed 
      between the groups, the presence of PCOS alongside GDM did not result in worse 
      outcomes for either the mother or the neonate in this cohort.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Until recently, the biological treatment options for hidradenitis 
      suppurativa (HS) were largely restricted to adalimumab and secukinumab. In 2024, 
      bimekizumab, an IL-17A and IL-17F antibody was introduced to the clinical 
      practice. AREAS COVERED: Bimekizumab offers a new therapeutic approach for 
      managing HS. It was approved by the U.S Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and 
      European Medicines Agency (EMA) in 2024. The available biologic therapies in HS 
      treatment are described. The data from phase II and phase III clinical trials 
      were analyzed to evaluate the bimekizumab effectiveness in HS treatment. Data 
      from those trials and latest summaries of product characteristics (SmPC) were 
      retrieved to investigate its safety profile. The current preliminary data 
      regarding its long-term effectiveness from BE HEARD EXT (NCT04901195) trial were 
      presented. EXPERT OPINION: The common side effects of bimekizumab were upper 
      respiratory infections, candida infections and eczematous reactions across all 
      indications. The favorable side effects profile and strong clinical effectiveness 
      proved in clinical trials gave the bimekizumab potential to become the 
      first-choice drug in HS treatment.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To analyze the chemical components of Mudan Huaban recipe (, MHR) and 
      evaluate its efficacy and possible mechanism in melasma mice. METHODS: The 
      chemical compositions of MHR were determined by the ultra-high performance liquid 
      chromatography coupled with quadrupole-exactive mass spectrometry method. Female 
      C57BL/6 mice were exposed to ultraviolet B and progesterone for 21 d to induce 
      melasma, and Fontana-Masson staining was used to assess the effects of MHR on 
      melasma. Luteinizing hormone (LH), estradiol, and follicle-stimulating hormone 
      levels were detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. The superoxide 
      dismutase (SOD) activity and malonic dialdehyde content were detected by 
      chemiluminescence. Tyrosinase and related proteins expressions were detected by 
      Western blots and immunohistochemistry. RESULTS: A total of 43 chemical 
      components were identified in MHR, MHR significantly decreased the melanin 
      particles of melasma mice. MHR treatment significantly reversed the high contents 
      of LH and low activity of SOD in models. MHR significantly reduced the higher 
      levels of tyrosinase, tyrosinase-related proteins-1 (TRP-1), TRP-2, 
      microphthalmia-associated transcription factor and phosphorylation of cyclic 
      adenosine monophosphate response element-binding protein (p-CREB)/CREB in the 
      skin of melasma mice. CONCLUSIONS: MHR protects against melasma via regulation of 
      sex hormones, oxidative stress, and melanogenesis-related proteins, suggesting 
      its possible use as a supplement and alternative drug therapy for melasma.

AB  - Tyrosinase (EC 1.14.18.1) is a pivotal enzyme that catalyzes the conversion of 
      L-tyrosine to dopaquinone through a dual oxidation process, initiating melanin 
      biosynthesis. Melanin plays a critical role in various biological processes, and 
      its overproduction is associated with multiple conditions. Tyrosinase plays a 
      crucial role in immune regulation by regulating the activity of immune cells and 
      enhancing the immune response of the body. It is essential for maintaining skin 
      health and preventing autoimmune diseases. In addition, tyrosinase has shown 
      potential in immunotherapy, especially in the treatment of malignant melanoma and 
      autoimmune diseases such as vitiligo. Inhibiting tyrosinase to reduce melanin 
      synthesis has emerged as a promising therapeutic strategy with applications in 
      skin whitening, melasma treatment, acne management, Parkinson's disease (PD) 
      intervention, melanoma prevention, and overcoming immunotherapy resistance. By 
      leveraging the tyrosinase-related comprehensive data documented in the BRENDA 
      database, we have systematically summarized the effective information, including 
      its classification, structural characteristics, catalytic functions, biosynthesis 
      pathways, substrate specificity profiles, reaction products, and associated 
      disease mechanisms, and so forth. This review comprehensively examines the 
      therapeutic mechanisms, development history, and current clinical status of 
      tyrosinase inhibitors at preclinical and advanced stages. We highlight recent 
      research progress, focusing on evidence from animal models, preclinical studies, 
      and human clinical trials across different indications. Additionally, we 
      critically analyze the challenges and limitations in the field and provide 
      insights into future directions for optimizing tyrosinase inhibitors. By 
      synthesizing current knowledge and advancements, this review aims to underscore 
      the therapeutic potential of tyrosinase inhibition and its role in addressing 
      diverse medical needs.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The concurrent use of tetracyclines and isotretinoin in acne 
      treatment can cause pseudotumor cerebri (PTC). However, topical minocycline (4%) 
      was significantly less systemically absorbed. AIM: To assess the efficacy and 
      safety of a combination of topical minocycline gel 4% with oral isotretinoin 
      compared to isotretinoin alone in the treatment of acne vulgaris in the Indian 
      population. MATERIAL AND METHODS: This prospective, randomised, comparative study 
      included 60 patients aged >/= 12 years with acne. Two groups were formed: the 
      Mino-Iso group applied minocycline gel 4% and took 20 mg isotretinoin capsules in 
      the evening, whereas the Iso group took only 20 mg isotretinoin capsules in the 
      evening. The study duration was 12 weeks. RESULTS: At week 12, the Mino-Iso group 
      showed a significantly greater reduction in inflammatory lesions (-88.5%) than 
      the Iso group (-67.42%) (p < 0.05). The investigator's global assessment (IGA) 
      treatment score was statistically lower and success significantly higher in the 
      Mino-Iso group (p < 0.05 and p = 0.03, respectively). Adverse events (AEs) were 
      reported in 6 and 4 patients in the Mino-Iso and Iso groups, respectively (p = 
      0.73), all of which were mild in nature and resolved during the study. 
      CONCLUSIONS: The combination of topical gel 4% and oral isotretinoin 20 mg 
      capsule significantly reduced inflammatory lesions, improved IGA scores, and had 
      a higher success rate at week 12 than isotretinoin alone, with similar 
      tolerability. Therefore, this combination can be considered a preferable 
      treatment option for moderate-to-severe acne.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dermatological problems are among the leading causes of hospital 
      visits in Ethiopia. Extemporaneous compounded products are currently used by many 
      patients with different disorders. The aim of the study was to evaluate the most 
      commonly prescribed extemporaneously compounded products compounding practice and 
      applicability of compounding guidelines at five randomly selected hospitals in 
      Northwest Ethiopia. METHODS: A hospital-based multicenter descriptive 
      cross-sectional study was conducted by retrospectively analyzing prescription 
      records for dermatological compounding from January to April 2023. A total of 423 
      prescriptions from hospital pharmacies were systematically selected. Data related 
      to skin condition patterns, product selection, and dosage form types were 
      extracted using a semi-structured data extraction tool and analyzed using SPSS 
      version 25.0 at a significance level of 5%. RESULTS: A total of 423 prescriptions 
      containing dermatological products for compounding were analyzed. Most patients 
      were female (82.1%) and aged 30-64 years (46.3%). Melasma (82.9%), acne vulgaris 
      (68.6%), acute dermatitis (63.27%), and Rosacea (61.54%) were the four top 
      dermatological diseases for which compounding preparations were prescribed. More 
      than half of the prescriptions (56.26%) contained a combination of two drugs. 
      Most compounded dosage form was semisolid preparations (95.98%), while the 
      remaining 17 (4.02%) were liquids. Salicylic acid (35.39%) was the most 
      frequently prescribed active ingredient, followed by Clobetasone (13.03%) and 
      Betamethasone (10.01%). Vaseline (47.62%) and Nivea cream (44.3%) were the most 
      commonly used excipients for compound preparations. Hydroquinone (4%) with Nivea 
      cream (30gm) (17.0%), followed by salicylic acid (5%) + Betamethasone 
      (75 g) + Vaseline (20 g) (10.6%) were the most commonly prescribed dermatological 
      formulations. CONCLUSION: Dermatological disease is more prevalent in the study 
      area. and extemporaneous compounding is a common element of pharmaceutical care. 
      Extemporaneous and topical semisolid preparations containing two or more active 
      ingredients are the most widely compounded and prescribed products. This study 
      suggests the application of good manufacturing practices and componding 
      guidelines for extemporaneous compounding of dermatological formulations to 
      ensure efficacy, quality, and safety.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Clindamycin hydrochloride, a first-line antibiotic for acne 
      treatment, faces challenges with poor skin penetration due to its hydrophilicity 
      and the barrier posed by the stratum corneum. To address this limitation, we 
      developed gelatin-methacryloyl (GelMA) hydrogel-based biodegradable microneedles 
      (GM-Clin-MN) for sustained intradermal drug delivery, thereby enhancing 
      therapeutic efficacy. METHODS: The microneedle patches loaded with 1 wt% 
      clindamycin hydrochloride were fabricated using PDMS molds and characterized 
      through scanning electron microscopy (SEM), Fourier-transform infrared 
      spectroscopy (FTIR), and fluorescence microscopy. Drug loading and release were 
      assessed using UV-Vis spectroscopy at 520 nm, while mechanical strength was 
      evaluated with a universal testing machine. Skin penetration was tested on ex 
      vivo rat abdominal skin. Biosafety was determined through human skin fibroblast 
      (HSF) cytotoxicity and hen's egg test-chorioallantoic membrane (HET-CAM) 
      irritation tests. Antibacterial efficacy against Cutibacterium acnes (C. acnes) 
      was measured via colony counting. In vivo acne treatment of the microneedles was 
      evaluated in a rat acne model. Gross morphological changes, histological 
      sections, and immunohistochemical staining were used to evaluate the efficacy and 
      potential mechanisms of acne treatment. RESULTS: Clindamycin hydrochloride-loaded 
      GelMA microneedles (GM-Clin-MN) achieved a drug loading of 0.49 +/- 
      0.025 mug/needle, exhibiting rapid release on Day 1 (54.8% +/- 2.1%) and sustained 
      release by Day 10 (72.1% +/- 1.5%). The microneedles penetrated the skin to a depth 
      of 658 +/- 66 mum, swelled by 185.4% +/- 12.1%, and completely dissolved within 
      10 min. GM-Clin-MN displayed no cytotoxicity or skin irritation and effectively 
      inhibited the growth of C. acnes (bacterial inhibition rate of 100%). In vivo 
      studies revealed that acne-related inflammation was effectively suppressed with 
      potential anti-scarring properties, characterized by reduced pro-inflammatory 
      IL-1beta levels, increased anti-inflammatory IL-10 expression, and diminished MMP-2 
      activity - a key enzyme in collagen overproduction during scarring. CONCLUSION: 
      GM-Clin-MN enables sustained, minimally invasive clindamycin delivery through the 
      stratum corneum, offering a dual-action therapeutic strategy that combines potent 
      antibacterial activity with anti-inflammatory modulation for acne management.

TI  - Effect of Intense Pulsed Light Combined With 3% Tranexamic Acid for Facial 
      Erythema Associated With Acne Vulgaris and Rosacea.
LID - 10.1002/lsm.70029 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Current treatment options for facial erythema associated with acne 
      and rosacea include oral and topical treatments. Physical modalities are also 
      commonly used recently. Combination therapy usually works better than a single 
      therapy. There are few studies on the therapeutic effect of IPL combined with TXA 
      on facial erythema. OBJECTIVE: To study the efficacy of intense pulsed light 
      combined with 3% tranexamic acid in the treatment of facial erythema associated 
      with acne and rosacea. METHODS: A total of 56 patients were included in the 
      study. They were randomly divided into the observation group and the control 
      group, with 28 cases in each group. The observation group was treated with 
      intense pulsed light combined with 3% tranexamic acid for external use, while the 
      control group was treated with intense pulsed light only. The clinical efficacy, 
      erythema degree, and skin disease quality of life index score before and after 
      treatment were observed in the two groups, and the results were compared. 
      RESULTS: After treatment, both groups showed improvement; the observation group 
      exhibited a significantly higher overall effective rate than the control group 
      (p < 0.05). The scores of erythema index and skin quality of life index in the 
      observation group were lower than those in the control group, and the differences 
      were statistically significant (p < 0.05). There were no obvious adverse 
      reactions in both groups. CONCLUSION: Intense pulsed light combined with 3% 
      tranexamic acid can effectively improve the degree of acne and rosacea erythema 
      without serious adverse effects.

AB  - Cannabidiol (CBD), a non-psychoactive chemical derived from Cannabis sativa L., 
      has significant dermatological potential due to its anti-inflammatory, 
      antioxidant, and wound healing attributes. However, its clinical usage is limited 
      by its instability, minimal skin penetration, and poor solubility. 
      Nanotechnology-based delivery systems such as Pickering emulsions, cryogels, 
      lipid nanoparticles, and nanomicelles have emerged promising strategies to 
      enhance localized skin delivery, improve penetration, enable sustained release, 
      and reduce adverse effects. According to this analysis of 16 papers and 18 
      patents (2019-2024), CBD that has been nanoformulated offers improved 
      tolerability, sustained release, and skin delivery. According to GRADE review, 
      impacts on dermal absorption, inflammation, and wound healing demonstrated 
      intermediate certainty, but outcomes such as skin penetration, controlled 
      release, and safety showed high certainty. Applications for acne, psoriasis, and 
      eczema show enhanced patient compliance and efficacy. Despite clinical and 
      regulatory obstacles, nano-CBD platforms provide a safe, focused, and efficient 
      approach to improving dermatological care.

AB  - Many reviews state that tetracyclines are contraindicated during breastfeeding 
      because of possible staining of infants' dental enamel or bone deposition of 
      tetracyclines. However, available literature indicates that there is not likely 
      to be harm in short-term use of minocycline during lactation because milk levels 
      are low and absorption by the infant is inhibited by the calcium in breastmilk. 
      Although the manufacturer recommends avoiding breastfeeding during administration 
      of minocycline and for 4 days after the last dose, short-term use of minocycline 
      is probably acceptable in nursing mothers. As a theoretical precaution, avoid 
      prolonged or repeat courses during nursing. Monitor the infant for rash and for 
      possible effects on the gastrointestinal flora, such as diarrhea or candidiasis 
      (thrush, diaper rash). Black discoloration of breastmilk has been reported with 
      minocycline. Topical minocycline for acne by the mother poses no risk to the 
      breastfed infant.

TI  - Good response to oxymetholone in adult aplastic anemia.
LID - 10.1007/s00277-025-06460-5 [doi]
AB  - In Thailand, stem cell transplantation and horse antithymocyte globulin (ATG) are 
      not accessible for most adult aplastic anemia (AA) patients. Alternative 
      therapies are required. We conducted a cohort study of 110 adult AA patients 
      treated with oxymetholone alone for at least 30 days from 2013 to 2023. Response 
      at month 6 and prognostic factors were evaluated. The mean age was 63.4 years old 
      and 58.2% were female. Severe and very severe AA (SAA/VSAA) comprised 64.5% and 
      3.6%, respectively. The initial oxymetholone daily dose was 150 mg in 66.4%. The 
      overall response was 56.4% (50.7% for SAA/VSAA), with a median time to 
      transfusion independence of 11.8 weeks. Deaths were regarded as no response. 
      Seventeen (17.9%) patients discontinued the treatment due to side effects, 
      especially hepatitis (15/17). Androgenic side effects (55.5%) mostly occurred 
      within the first month. Multivariate analysis identified that baseline 
      reticulocyte count > 10 x 10(9)/L (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 7.3, 95% confidence 
      interval [CI] (2.55-21.11), oily skin (OR 4.93, 95%CI 1.50-16.26) and acne (OR 
      9.78, 95%CI 2.11-45.28) occurring within 2 months were predictive for responses. 
      The SKAR scoring system using these three factors showed an area under the ROC 
      curve of 0.87 (95%CI 0.80-0.92). The 5-year overall survival rate was 77.4%. Poor 
      performance status (p < 0.001) and response status (p < 0.001) significantly 
      impacted mortality. Responding patients demonstrated 94.5% 5-year survival. In 
      conclusion, androgen is a useful treatment option for AA in Thailand. The score 
      based on reticulocytes and androgenic effects could predict the response and 
      potentially help decision-making.

TI  - A systematic review of comparative clinical trials on the efficacy, safety, and 
      patient satisfaction of ablative and non-ablative laser therapies for atrophic, 
      hypertrophic, and keloid scars.
PG  - 280

AB  - Scar formation is a common outcome of tissue injury, manifesting as atrophic, 
      hypertrophic, and keloid scars, which can significantly impact quality of life. 
      Laser therapy has emerged as a promising treatment modality for scars, 
      encompassing ablative and non-ablative approaches, yet there are gaps in 
      understanding their comparative efficacy, safety, and patient satisfaction. This 
      study aims to comprehensively review published research comparing the efficacy, 
      safety, and patient satisfaction of various laser therapies for treating 
      atrophic, hypertrophic, and keloid scars. A systematic review was conducted 
      following the PRISMA guidelines, involving comprehensive searches of PubMed, 
      Embase, Web of Science, and Scopus for human comparative clinical trials 
      published in English from January 2010 to February 2024. Studies were included if 
      they compared two or more laser types for the treatment of scars. Risk of bias 
      was assessed using the Cochrane ROB2 tool. Out of 5951 records retrieved, 39 
      studies involving 1262 participants were included. The majority focused on 
      atrophic scars (48.7%), with treatment typically consisting of three sessions at 
      four-week intervals. Results indicated that ablative lasers, particularly CO2 and 
      Er: YAG, were more effective for atrophic scars but associated with higher pain 
      and downtime. For hypertrophic and keloid scars, both ablative and non-ablative 
      lasers yielded comparable results, especially in combination therapies. Notably, 
      patient skin type influenced treatment choice due to the risk of 
      post-inflammatory hyperpigmentation. Laser therapy is effective for various scar 
      types, with ablative lasers preferred for atrophic scars, albeit with increased 
      pain and downtime. Both laser types are effective for hypertrophic and keloid 
      scars, and combination treatments can enhance outcomes. Personalized treatment 
      approaches considering skin type are essential to minimize adverse effects. 
      Further research is warranted to refine laser parameters and assess long-term 
      efficacy and patient satisfaction. WHAT IS ALREADY KNOWN ABOUT THIS TOPIC?: * 
      Scar formation is a common outcome of the wound healing process, resulting in 
      various scar types, including atrophic, hypertrophic, and keloid scars. These 
      scars can significantly reduce the quality of life for affected individuals. * 
      Laser therapy has emerged as a developed technology for scar treatment, utilizing 
      heat and light for coagulation and tissue reconstruction. Laser modalities are 
      primarily categorized into ablative (e.g., CO2 and Er: YAG lasers) and 
      non-ablative types, each targeting different scar characteristics. * Despite 
      advancements, significant gaps exist in knowledge regarding the long-term 
      efficacy of laser treatments, pain management, and overall patient satisfaction. 
      Critical factors influencing treatment outcomes include the timing of therapy 
      initiation, the type of laser used, and the intervals between treatments. WHAT 
      DOES THIS STUDY ADD?: * A total of 1262 participants were included in the 
      studies, with 54.6% being females. The majority of studies focused on atrophic 
      scars (64.1%), particularly acne scars (48.7%), while studies on hypertrophic and 
      keloid scars accounted for 35.9% of the included. * Scar improvement was assessed 
      using standard existing scoring scales in 67.7% of cases, with the Visual Analog 
      Scale (VAS) being used to measure pain in 57.1% of studies. Treatment protocols 
      typically consisted of 3 sessions at 4-week intervals, with follow-up visits 
      scheduled 1 to 6 months after the final treatment session. * In a comparison of 
      the 2940 nm Er: YAG laser versus the Long-pulse 1064 nm Nd: YAG laser for 
      treating acne scars, 52.3% of patients treated with the Er: YAG laser experienced 
      improvement, while only 25% of patients treated with the Nd: YAG laser reported 
      similar results. * In a study comparing ablative 10600 nm fx CO2 lasers with 
      nonablative 1550 nm Er: glass lasers for treating acne scars, over 50% recovery 
      was achieved in 37.5% of patients treated with the fx CO2 laser, while only 12.5% 
      of patients had similar recovery with the non-ablative 1550 nm Er: glass laser. * 
      In a comparison of the 2940 nm Er: YAG laser with the Fractional CO2 laser for 
      treating acne scars, the fx CO2 laser achieved an improvement of over 50% in 65% 
      of patients, while the 2940 nm Er: YAG laser demonstrated improvement in 55% of 
      patients, with no statistically significant difference between the two (p > 
      0.05). * In a study comparing the 1064 nm Nd: YAG laser with a diffractive 
      optical element to the non-ablative 1550 nm Er: glass laser for atrophic acne 
      scars, the Nd: YAG laser group demonstrated a 55% improvement in the ECCA 
      criterion, while the Er: glass laser group showed a 42% improvement. * In a 
      comparison between the 1550 nm Er: fiber laser and the 755 nm Picosecond laser 
      for treating atrophic acne scars, 73.91% of patients who received the 1550 nm Er: 
      fiber laser experienced a 26%-50% improvement, while all patients treated with 
      the 755 nm Picosecond laser showed only a 1%-25% improvement, indicating 
      significantly greater effectiveness of the Er: fiber laser (P < 0.05). * In a 
      study comparing the 10600 nm fx CO2 laser and the 1550 nm Er: glass laser for 
      treating hypertrophic scars, the mean improvement was 2.35 +/- 0.85 for the Er: 
      glass group and 2.45 +/- 0.99 for the fx CO2 group over a three-month period, 
      indicating no statistically significant difference between the two (p > 0.05). * 
      A study assessing the effectiveness of the CO2 laser, Nd: YAG 1064-nm laser, and 
      their combination for treating hypertrophic scars reported recovery rates of 
      47.33% for the CO2 laser, 41.19% for the Nd: YAG laser, and 44.92% for the 
      combination group, with no statistically significant differences among the groups 
      (p > 0.05). * In a comparative study of the 2940 nm Er: YAG laser versus the 1550 
      nm Er: glass laser for treating hypertrophic and keloid scars, 85.7% of patients 
      reported a better overall appearance in the areas treated with the Er: YAG laser, 
      and 71.4% noted an improved cosmetic appearance in that area compared to the 
      opposite site. * In a comparative study evaluating the effectiveness of the 2940 
      nm Er: YAG laser versus the Fractional CO2 laser for treating hypertrophic and 
      keloid scars, the first study showed a 49.8% reduction in the Vancouver Scar 
      Scale (VSS) for the fx CO2 group compared to 28.2% for the Er: YAG group, with 
      this difference being statistically significant; however, a second study found no 
      significant difference between the two lasers over three months. * In a study 
      comparing the 532 nm potassium titanyl phosphate (KTP) laser with the 595 nm 
      pulsed dye laser (PDL) over a 12-week period, the median improvement score for 
      the KTP laser group was 2, while the PDL group had a score of 1.5; however, no 
      significant difference was observed between the two groups. * In a comparative 
      study of the pulsed dye laser (PDL) and the 1064 nm Nd: YAG laser for 
      treatinghypertrophic scars and keloids, the recovery rate for the Nd: YAG group 
      was 65.44%, whereas the PDL group had a recovery rate of 55.14%. While both 
      groups showed significant improvement, no notable difference was observed between 
      the two treatments.

AB  - The skin can generate hormones through de novo steroid hormone synthesis. These 
      hormones have been shown to play a significant role in inflammatory skin 
      conditions through the regulation of skin immunity, sebum production, and skin 
      barrier function. Although there is growing interest in understanding the 
      composition and function of skin hormones throughout the human lifespan and in 
      various pathologies, there remains a need to standardize sampling and 
      quantification methods. In this article, we discuss an emerging noninvasive 
      approach in skin hormone quantification through adhesive sebum collection tape 
      followed by analysis through mass spectrometry or hormone-specific immunoassays. 
      This approach is highly adaptable, allowing for repetitive sampling over time and 
      across diverse study populations.

TI  - Mobile health intervention for type 2 diabetes management delivered by community 
      health workers and clinical pharmacists: Intervention costs and healthcare 
      resource utilization.
LID - zxaf153 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/ajhp/zxaf153 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: As the prevalence of diabetes continues to rise, innovative strategies 
      are essential to optimize patient outcomes while curbing the economic burden on 
      healthcare systems. This study aims to describe the costs of implementing a 
      team-based mobile health intervention for diabetes management (the mDAS 
      intervention) that successfully lowered glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in African 
      American and Latinx adults with type 2 diabetes from a health-system perspective, 
      and to compare healthcare resource utilization (HCRU) and associated costs 
      between the intervention and usual care groups over one year. METHODS: 
      Intervention delivery costs were described by providing a breakdown of start-up 
      and operating costs. Frequencies of outpatient, inpatient, and emergency 
      department (ED) visits and associated charges were obtained using health system 
      billing data. Negative binomial regression models were employed to compare 
      frequencies of visits, and gamma regression models to assess differences in total 
      healthcare costs. RESULTS: The total cost of implementing the mDAS intervention 
      for 1 year was $56,032. This includes $11,627 in start-up costs and $44,660 in 
      annual operational costs. The intervention (n = 108) and usual care (n = 112) 
      groups exhibited similar rates of outpatient visits (rate ratio [RR], 1.07; P = 
      0.52), ED visits (RR, 0.82; P = 0.68), and total healthcare costs (cost ratio, 
      1.03; P = 0.86) over 1 year. CONCLUSION: The mDAS intervention incurred modest 
      implementation costs. It did not result in significant differences in short-term 
      HCRU and associated costs when compared to usual care. Future research should 
      explore specific mechanisms impacting HCRU and the long-term cost-effectiveness 
      of implementing such interventions more broadly in nonacademic clinical 
      environments.

AB  - BACKGROUND: This proof-of-concept study tested the feasibility and acceptability 
      of INTEGRATE-D, an implementation support intervention for primary care clinics 
      to improve the psychosocial care of patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: 
      Cluster randomized controlled pragmatic trial, with a parallel, convergent mixed 
      methods design. Two Intervention Clinics (ICs) were offered tailored training on 
      American Diabetes Association (ADA)-recommended psychosocial care and 
      facilitation to identify and support clinical change. Two Control Clinics (CCs) 
      received no intervention. PRIMARY OUTCOMES: intervention acceptability, 
      appropriateness and feasibility. SECONDARY OUTCOMES: process-of-care metrics (eg, 
      depression screening, diabetes management) and clinical outcomes measures (PHQ-9 
      and A1C). Qualitative data were collected to assess implementation and experience 
      with the intervention. RESULTS: ICs were offered training and received 15-months 
      of facilitation. To accommodate COVID-19-related safety restrictions, the 
      intervention was changed to be delivered virtually (eg, remote facilitation and 
      training sessions). Despite an adapted delivery and COVID-19 and staffing 
      stressors, clinics exposed to INTEGRATE-D found it to be acceptable, well-aligned 
      with clinics' needs, and feasible. Qualitative data suggest COVID-19 stressors 
      tempered feasibility. The effect of INTEGRATE-D on process and clinical outcome 
      measures were mixed. Several factors, including differences in ICs and CCs not 
      addressed in randomization and delivery of a less intensive intervention due to 
      the pandemic, may help explain these results. CONCLUSIONS: Given the growing 
      number of people with type 2 diabetes and the importance of psychosocial care for 
      these patients, INTEGRATE-D warrants further pilot-testing with a larger sample 
      of clinics and patients, and under conditions where in-person facilitation and 
      expanded training is possible.

AB  - AIMS: To investigate the accessibility, credibility, emotional responses, and 
      impacts of cardiovascular risk visualizations in motivating self-management of 
      young-onset type 2 diabetes (YOD). METHODS: We conducted a mixed-methods study 
      among adults with YOD (age at diagnosis < 40 years, disease duration < 10 years) 
      in Ontario, Canada. We created 6 visualizations (5-year risk: linear scale, icon 
      array, bar graph; lifetime risk: bar graph, icon array; cardiovascular age). We 
      measured numeracy, graph literacy, accessibility, credibility, and emotional 
      responses. We used linear regression to measure associations among these 
      variables. We conducted semi-structured interviews to explore impacts on 
      motivation. RESULTS: We included 31 participants (54.8% women, mean age 37.5 
      years). The lifetime risk bar graph and icon array received the highest 
      accessibility (P = 0.008), similarly high credibility (P = 0.1), the highest 
      negative emotion (P = 0.004), and similar positive emotion (P = 0.6) scores 
      compared to the other visualizations. The lifetime risk visualizations evoked 
      feelings of urgency or fear, which strongly enhanced motivation. Only the 
      lifetime risk bar graph had high accessibility and credibility scores across all 
      levels of numeracy and graph literacy. Graph literacy was negatively associated 
      with positive emotion. CONCLUSIONS: Lifetime risk visualizations, especially bar 
      graphs, are more accessible and emotionally evocative in potentially motivating 
      self-management of YOD than other visualizations.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes increases healthcare load and seriously compromises quality 
      of life. This study aimed to develop a hospital-based educational and follow-up 
      strategy at Ziaeian Hospital and assess how it affected the diabetic patients' 
      health outcomes. METHODS: This study was a community-level intervention based on 
      Compassion-Focused Therapy (CFT). The study was conducted from 2020 to 2022 at 
      Ziaeian Hospital in District 17 of Tehran, involving 312 diabetic patients. 
      Participants were randomly allocated to two groups: the intervention group 
      (n = 156) and the control group (n = 156). The intervention group received 
      structured education, continuous follow-up, and family engagement, while the 
      control group underwent standard treatment. Data were collected using a 
      researcher-developed questionnaire and the SF-36 quality of life assessment. 
      Statistical analyses were performed using STATA version 14.02, with significance 
      set at P < 0.05. The statistical tests employed included t-tests, Chi-squared 
      tests, Fisher's exact test, and paired t-test. RESULT: The mortality rate in the 
      control group was therefore 9.03%, higher than the 5.52% noted in the 
      intervention group. Baseline clinical markers (FBS, HbA1c, triglycerides, 
      cholesterol, and BMI) showed no appreciable differences across the groups. Though 
      no significant changes in social functioning, mental health, or physical 
      performance, the intervention group showed notable improvements in overall 
      quality of life (p = 0.0053), general health (p < 0.0001), energy/fatigue 
      (p < 0.0001). CONCLUSION: In conclusion, systematic instruction and continuous 
      monitoring improved quality of life and lower mortality among diabetics. These

AB  - Background Effective patient-provider communication is critical for managing 
      chronic diseases like diabetes mellitus (DM). This study examines whether patient 
      attitudes toward their healthcare providers influence diabetes management and 
      compliance, comparing individuals with poorly managed diabetes mellitus (PM DM) 
      and those without DM (No DM).  Methods Data from the All of Us Research Program 
      was analyzed. After excluding incomplete responses, the final sample included 
      1903 PM DM patients and 94,218 No DM patients. Patient perceptions of respect, 
      involvement in medical decision making, and provider interactions were assessed. 
      Bivariate analysis was used to identify responses that were independently 
      associated with PM DM. Variables found to be independently associated with PM DM 
      at p<0.10 were entered into a multivariable model, and backwards stepwise binary 
      logistic regression was used to find the model of best fit. Variables found to be 
      significant (p<0.05) in the multivariable model were retained.  Results Patients 
      who felt disrespected by providers were significantly more likely to have poorly 
      managed diabetes (OR = 1.396, 95% CI: 1.189, 1.639, p<0.05). Counterintuitively, 
      patients who reported always being asked for their opinion in treatment decisions 
      were likely to have PM DM (OR = 1.466, 95% CI: 1.235, 1.740, p<0.05). Patients 
      who were not nervous to see their provider were also more likely to have PM DM 
      (OR = 1.365, 95% CI: 1.152, 1.618, p<0.05). Conclusion Findings suggest that 
      positive provider interaction does not always translate to better disease 
      control. Future studies should explore how communication styles and shared 
      decision-making impact long-term adherence to diabetes treatment.

TI  - Revolutionizing Diabetes Management Through Nanotechnology-Driven Smart Systems.
LID - 777 [pii]
LID - 10.3390/pharmaceutics17060777 [doi]
AB  - Diabetes is a global health challenge, and while current treatments offer relief, 
      they often fall short in achieving optimal control and long-term outcomes. 
      Nanotechnology offers a groundbreaking approach to diabetes management by 
      leveraging materials at the nanoscale to improve drug delivery, glucose 
      monitoring, and therapeutic precision. Early advancements focused on enhancing 
      insulin delivery through smart nanosystems such as tiny capsules that gradually 
      release insulin, helping prevent dangerous drops in blood sugar. Simultaneously, 
      the development of nanosensors has revolutionised glucose monitoring, offering 
      real-time, continuous data that empowers individuals to manage their condition 
      more effectively. Beyond insulin delivery and monitoring, nanotechnology enables 
      targeted drug delivery systems that allow therapeutic agents to reach specific 
      tissues, boosting efficacy while minimising side effects. Tools like 
      microneedles, carbon nanomaterials, and quantum dots have made treatment less 
      invasive and more patient-friendly. The integration of artificial intelligence 
      (AI) with nanotechnology marks a new frontier in personalised care. AI algorithms 
      can analyse individual patient data to adjust insulin doses and predict glucose 
      fluctuations, paving the way for more responsive, customised treatment plans. As 
      these technologies advance, safety remains a key concern. Rigorous research is 
      underway to ensure the biocompatibility and long-term safety of these novel 
      materials. The future of diabetes care lies in the convergence of nanotechnology 
      and AI, offering personalised, data-driven strategies that address the 
      limitations of conventional approaches. This review explores current progress, 
      persistent challenges, and the transformative potential of nanotechnology in 
      reshaping diabetes diagnosis and treatment and improving patient quality of life.

TI  - The Clinically Significant Changes in the Composition and Functional Diversity of 
      the Vaginal Microbiome in Women with Type 2 Diabetes Mellitus.
LID - 10.3390/microorganisms13061426 [doi]
LID - 1426
AB  - Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) significantly influences the composition and 
      diversity of the vaginal microbiome, with implications for mucosal immunity, 
      infection risk, and genitourinary health. This study aimed to investigate the 
      vaginal microbiome profiles in women with T2DM, with a focus on differences 
      according to menopausal status and associations with Candida colonization and the 
      use of sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors. Compared to healthy 
      controls, women with T2DM exhibited a decreased abundance of Lactobacillus 
      species and increased microbial diversity. Community state of type (CST) IV, 
      characterized by low Lactobacillus abundance and dominance of anaerobic taxa, was 
      prevalent in the T2DM group. Among Candida-positive patients, Lactobacillus 
      iners-dominant CST III was frequently observed, along with elevated levels of 
      total and L-lactic acid. SGLT2 inhibitor users exhibited a different CST 
      distribution pattern and slightly lower microbial richness and diversity, 
      although these differences were not statistically significant. These findings 
      underscore the impact of T2DM and its treatment on vaginal microbial composition 
      and highlight the importance of considering vaginal health as part of 
      comprehensive diabetes management in women.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Dysiosis in gut and vaginal microbiome is implicated in type 2 
      diabetes (T2D) pathogenesis, but their contributions remain unclear. This study 
      aims to compare their alterations and clinical relevance in diabetes development. 
      METHODS: Metagenomic sequencing was performed on vaginal and fecal samples from 
      T2D patients. Differential feature selection and correlation model were used to 
      dissect microbial contributions to diabetic markers. RESULTS: Gut microbiota 
      exhibited reduced diversity in T2D patients, with enrichment of Desulfovibrio 
      desulfuricans and Adlercreutzia equolifaciens validated in public cohorts. 
      Vaginal microbiota diversity remained unaffected. Furthermore, structural 
      equation modeling revealed stronger gut microbiota associations with blood 
      glucose and HbA1c. Notably, Romboutsia ilealis-derived pgm was enriched in the 
      diabetes group, which could catalyze the production of glucose, suggesting that 
      it may be involved in the progression of T2D. CONCLUSION: Our findings establish 
      the gut microbiome as the dominant driver of T2D progression, with R. ilealis 
      emerging as a potential therapeutic target. This highlights the priority of 
      gut-centric microbiota interventions in diabetes management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As the prevalence of diabetes and its related complications continues 
      to rise, understanding the factors that influence glycemic control is crucial for 
      improving patient outcomes. This study aimed to explore the roles of 
      self-management, social support, and self-efficacy in moderating fasting blood 
      glucose (FBG) levels in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). 
      METHODS: A health facility-based cross-sectional study was conducted in Windhoek, 
      Namibia with a sample size of 315 T2DM patients receiving follow-up care. 
      Descriptive statistics and Pearson correlation analysis were conducted to examine 
      the relationship between self-management and FBG. Linear regression and 
      moderation analyses were used to determine the moderating effects. RESULTS: The 
      study revealed 34.3% engaged in self-monitoring of FBG, while medication 
      adherence was high at an average of 7 days. A significant negative correlation 
      between self-management practices and FBG levels was identified (r = -0.349, p < 
      0.028). Self-management, self-efficacy, and social support accounted for 43.1% of 
      FBG variation, with self-management emerging as a significant predictor (beta = 
      -0.903, p < 0.001). Additionally, social support and self-efficacy significantly 
      moderated the relationship between self-management and FBG levels. CONCLUSION: 
      This study showed the significant moderating roles of social support and 
      self-efficacy in the relationship between self-management practices and FBG 
      levels in patients with diabetes. These results highlight the importance of 
      comprehensive diabetes management programs focusing on individual behavioral 
      changes, enhancing social support networks, and boosting self-efficacy.

      Lifestyle Factors in Hospitalized Diabetic Patients.
LID - 10.3390/jcm14124201 [doi]
LID - 4201
AB  - Background/Objectives: Diabetes mellitus is associated with significant health 
      complications, including challenges in periodontal health. Gingival inflammation 
      is especially common among diabetic patients and can significantly impact overall 
      diabetes management. This study aims to investigate the correlation between 
      glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, an established marker of glycemic 
      control, and gingival inflammation using the Quantitative Gingival Bleeding Index 
      (QGBI) among hospitalized diabetic patients, thereby placing the question within 
      a broader clinical context. Methods: The study enrolled 671 hospitalized patients 
      with diabetes complications at ""Mother Theresa University Hospital"" in Tirana, 
      AL, USA. Glycemic control was assessed through glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) 
      levels, and gingival health was evaluated using the Quantitative Gingival 
      Bleeding Index (QGBI). Behavioral variables were also documented, including 
      smoking habits and routine oral care practices. Spearman's correlation 
      coefficient (r(s)) was applied to determine the relationship between HbA1c levels 
      and QGBI scores. Results: Our findings revealed a strong positive correlation 
      between glycemic control (HbA1c) and gingival inflammation (QGBI) among the 
      participants (Spearman's coefficient r(s) = 0.868, p < 0.001). Additionally, 
      significant positive associations were observed between behavioral factors, such 
      as smoking habits and regular oral care practices, further underscoring their 
      role in periodontal health in diabetic patients. Conclusions: The study 
      highlights a significant positive relationship between poor glycemic control and 
      increased gingival inflammation, emphasizing the importance of periodontal health 
      in the comprehensive management of diabetes mellitus. Our results support 
      integrating periodontal evaluation and management into standard diabetes care, 
      which could improve patient outcomes and overall well-being.

TI  - Why Do Individuals with Diabetes Miss Their Dietitian Appointments? A 
      Mixed-Methods Study on Barriers and Strategies for Improved Engagement in 
      Diabetes Care.
LID - 10.3390/healthcare13121409 [doi]
LID - 1409
AB  - Background/Objectives: Nonattendance at healthcare appointments remains a major 
      challenge, particularly in chronic diseases like diabetes. Dietary therapy is 
      essential in diabetes care, yet nonattendance at dietitian appointments persists. 
      This study aimed to identify key drivers of nonattendance at dietitian 
      appointments, explore prior experiences with dietary counseling, and determine 
      factors motivating attendance. Methods: A mixed-methods approach was used in this 
      quality improvement project, drawing on multiple data sources to explore 
      nonattendance at dietitian appointments. This included combining a retrospective 
      analysis of clinical and attendance data from patient records at a Danish 
      outpatient diabetes clinic with semi-structured interviews with 25 individuals 
      who had recently missed a dietitian appointment. Quantitative and qualitative 
      data were analyzed separately and then integrated to characterize overall 
      nonattendance patterns. Interview data were analyzed using systematic text 
      condensation. Results: Individuals who missed dietitian appointments were also 
      more likely to miss other healthcare appointments. Vulnerable individuals (i.e., 
      those with complex health conditions or mental health issues) were more likely to 
      miss appointments. Four principal barriers to attendance were identified: 
      administrative, digital, and logistical challenges; competing health concerns; 
      personal priorities; and unclear referral communication and patient involvement. 
      Conclusions: Improving attendance at dietitian appointments requires a 
      multifaceted approach. Key recommendations include optimizing scheduling 
      practices, implementing digital reminders, offering continuity of care and 
      virtual consultation options. Referring clinicians should improve patient 
      communication by clearly explaining the purpose of the dietitian consultation and 
      involving patients in shared decision-making prior to referral. Dietitians should 
      collaborate with patients to establish realistic, personalized goals to foster 
      engagement in their diabetes management.

TI  - A Scoping Review of the Relationship Between Psychological (In)flexibility and 
      Living with and Managing Type 1 and Type 2 Diabetes.
LID - 10.3390/bs15060792 [doi]
LID - 792
AB  - Diabetes Mellitus (DM) is highly prevalent and carries a significant 
      self-management burden and elevated risk of biopsychosocial sequelae. 
      Psychological flexibility (PF) has been shown to benefit living with and managing 
      chronic health conditions. The present scoping review aimed to synthesize the 
      available evidence on the relationship between PF and factors central to living 
      with and managing DM. A systematic literature search was conducted. Studies were 
      included if they measured psychological (in)flexibility (PI/PF) and/or one of its 
      component processes and sampled individuals with type 1 or type 2 DM. A total of 
      48 articles were included. Eighteen (37.5%) sampled individuals with T2D, 16 
      (33.3%) sampled individuals with T1D, and 14 (29.2%) had mixed diagnostic 
      samples. Twenty-nine (60.4%) reported observational studies, and 19 (39.6%) 
      reported 18 intervention studies. Studies were conducted across 17 countries and 
      broadly found that PI/PF were associated with many clinically meaningful DM 
      variables (e.g., HbA1c, diabetes distress, quality of life, and self-management). 
      Intervention studies including individual, group, and digital Acceptance and 
      Commitment Therapy (ACT) interventions showed trends for beneficial change in 
      PI/PF and diabetes outcomes, but some findings were mixed, and many studies were 
      underpowered. Only two studies tested change in PI/PF as a mediator of 
      diabetes-related outcomes, and most studies used the Acceptance and Action 
      Questionnaire, which has been increasingly criticized for poor discriminant 
      validity. Overall, findings show PI/PF are associated with most aspects of living 
      with and managing diabetes and are generally amenable to change through ACT 
      interventions. However, more methodologically rigorous studies are needed to 
      determine whether PI/PF are active change processes in improving diabetes 
      management and outcomes. Six key calls to action are presented to expand and 
      strengthen this important area of research.

TI  - The Validation of the Parental Self-Efficacy Scale for Diabetes Management Among 
      Parents of Children Wearing a Continuous Glucose Monitoring Sensor.
LID - 10.3390/biomedicines13061309 [doi]
LID - 1309
AB  - Background/Objectives: Parental involvement is essential in managing type 1 
      diabetes mellitus (T1DM) in children, particularly with the growing use of 
      continuous glucose monitoring (CGM). Validated tools assessing parental 
      self-efficacy in this context remain limited. This study aimed to validate the 
      Parental Self-Efficacy Scale for Diabetes Management (PSESDM) among parents of 
      children using a CGM sensor and to examine its associations with diabetes 
      outcomes and parental characteristics. Methods: A cross-sectional study was 
      conducted involving 106 parent-child dyads at a university pediatric diabetes 
      center. Parents completed the Hungarian PSESDM. Data regarding children's HbA1c 
      level were recorded, along with standard measures of their general and 
      diabetes-specific quality of life (EQ-5D-Y-3L, PedsQL Diab); data regarding 
      parents' health literacy (Chew), fear of hypoglycemia (HFS), health-related 
      quality of life (EQ-5D-5L), and capability well-being (ICECAP-A) were also 
      collected. The PSESDM's reliability, internal consistency, and discriminant and 
      criterion validity were assessed using standard statistical methods. Results: The 
      PSESDM demonstrated good internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha = 0.857) and strong 
      item-total correlations (range: 0.678-0.791). Higher parental self-efficacy was 
      significantly associated with better glucose control (lower HbA1c, r(s) = -0.50) 
      and weakly correlated with the child's diabetes-specific quality of life (r(s) = 
      0.20). Among parental characteristics, self-efficacy correlated strongly with 
      capability well-being (r(s) = 0.52), moderately with health literacy (r(s) = 
      -0.30), and showed no difference between socio-demographic subgroups, except for 
      the subgroup related to income. Conclusions: The PSESDM is a valid and reliable 
      tool for measuring self-efficacy in parents of children with T1DM using CGM 
      sensors. Its associations with children's HbA1c levels, diabetes-specific quality 
      of life, and parental characteristics support its clinical relevance and 
      potential use in identifying families at risk for poorer diabetes outcomes.

TI  - Young Adults With Type 1 Diabetes and Their Perspectives on Diabetes-Related 
      Social Media: Qualitative Study.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Young adults with type 1 diabetes (T1D) often struggle with 
      self-management and achieving target glycemic control, and thus, may benefit from 
      additional support during this challenging developmental life stage. They are 
      also some of the highest users of social media (SM), which may have some benefits 
      to young people with T1D. OBJECTIVE: Given the potential of SM support for people 
      with diabetes, we sought to use qualitative methods to explore the perceptions of 
      diabetes SM posts to influence self-care and emotional state of young adults with 
      T1D. METHODS: A series of Instagram (Meta) posts were selected by a 
      multidisciplinary team of T1D experts. Young adults aged 18-25 years with T1D 
      duration of 1 year or more were recruited from the clinic to participate in a 
      60-minute semistructured videoconferencing interview. First, they were queried 
      about their SM use in general and specific to diabetes. Next, they reviewed 10 
      posts with the interviewer. For each post, perceptions and reactions were 
      queried. Participants were asked about each post's impact on their emotional 
      state and potential influence on diabetes self-care. Finally, they were asked to 
      comment on what the posts emphasized and how they felt after viewing the posts. 
      Interviews were transcribed and coded using thematic analysis. The participants' 
      diabetes management information was extracted from the electronic health record. 
      RESULTS: There were 26 young adults who completed the study. Their mean (SD) age 
      was 22.6 (SD 2.0) years, T1D duration 12.6 (SD 5.9) years, and glycated 
      hemoglobin (HbA1c) 7.6 (SD 1.2%). In this sample, 65.3 were female and 84.6% 
      White. All were using continuous glucose monitors (CGMs) and 80.7% used insulin 
      pumps, 71.4% of which were hybrid closed loop. All participants used SM at least 
      once daily, but most only sometimes or rarely used SM to access diabetes content 
      and rarely or never posted diabetes content themselves. Major themes arising from 
      the interviews centered on the potential for the young adult to connect 
      emotionally through SM, which could be either positive or negative. Overall, for 
      young adults with T1D, SM served to (1) highlight the existence of a community of 
      people with T1D, (2) be a source of new diabetes information, (3) potentially 
      influence diabetes self-management, (4) potentially influence emotional state, 
      and (5) be appealing to the T1D community when the posts possessed certain 
      characteristics (eg, medical accuracy, aesthetically appealing presentation of 
      content). CONCLUSIONS: SM has the potential to help young adults with T1D feel a 
      sense of community, seek and share objective and subjective thoughts and feelings 
      about diabetes, motivate diabetes self-care, and positively affect emotional 
      state. However, it may also have the potential to demotivate self-care and 
      exacerbate negative emotional state with regards to diabetes.

AB  - Hypoglycemia is a major challenge for people with diabetes. Therefore, glycemic 
      monitoring is an important aspect of diabetes management. However, current 
      methods such as finger pricking and continuous glucose monitoring systems (CGMS) 
      are invasive, and hypoglycemia has still been shown to occur despite advancements 
      in CGMS. Consequently, a growing body of research has been directed toward 
      noninvasive hypoglycemia detection, relying on data from medical devices and 
      wearables that can record physiological changes elicited by hypoglycemia. 
      Consumer-grade wearables such as smartwatches remain an attractive yet 
      underexplored candidate for such applications. Therefore, we explored the 
      potential of a consumer-grade wearable for hypoglycemia prediction and 
      investigated differing feature importance during waking and sleeping times. 
      Smartwatch data from 18 adults with type 1 diabetes was collected, preprocessed, 
      and imputed. Machine learning (ML) models were built using a tree-based ensemble 
      algorithm to detect hypoglycemic events registered by CGMS. Models were built in 
      a personalized manner using the same participant's data for training and testing, 
      with separate modeling for daytime and nighttime. The relative importance of 
      input features on model decisions was analyzed using SHAP (SHapley Additive 
      exPlanations). Seventeen personalized models were built with an average area 
      under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUROC) score of 0.74 +/- 0.08. 
      Average specificity and sensitivity were 0.76 +/- 0.18 and 0.71 +/- 0.15, 
      respectively. Time-of-day, activity, and cardiac features showed comparable 
      importance in daytime models (29.9%, 28.5%, and 24%, respectively), while in 
      nighttime models, cardiac features demonstrated the highest importance (42.2%) 
      followed by time-of-day features (37.5%) and respiratory features (15.2%). In 
      summary, we demonstrate the potential of consumer-grade wearables in noninvasive 
      hypoglycemia detection. By additionally considering different physiological 
      states (waking and sleeping) during modeling, our results offer further insights 
      into differences in relative feature importance influencing the model's decision, 
      guiding future research in this area.

AB  - Diabetic foot ulcers (DFU) represent a major complication of diabetes mellitus, 
      affecting millions of patients worldwide and leading to high morbidity and 
      amputation risks. The impaired healing process in DFU is driven by vascular 
      insufficiency, neuropathy, chronic inflammation, and infections. Conventional 
      treatments, including blood sugar control, wound debridement, and standard 
      dressings, have shown limited efficacy in achieving complete healing. Recent 
      advancements have introduced novel therapeutic approaches such as stem cell 
      therapy, exosome-based treatments, and bioengineered scaffolds to accelerate 
      wound healing and tissue regeneration. Mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), 
      particularly adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs), exhibit anti-inflammatory, 
      pro-angiogenic, and immunomodulatory properties, enhancing wound repair. 
      Additionally, exosomes derived from ASCs have demonstrated the ability to promote 
      fibroblast proliferation, regulate inflammation, and stimulate angiogenesis. The 
      integration of bioengineered scaffolds, including hydrogels, hyaluronic acid 
      (HA), or micro-fragmented adipose tissue (MFAT), offers improved drug delivery 
      mechanisms and a controlled healing environment. These scaffolds have been 
      successfully utilized to deliver stem cells, growth factors, antioxidants, 
      anti-glycation end products, anti-inflammatory and anti-diabetic drugs, or 
      antimicrobial agents, further improving DFU outcomes. This review highlights the 
      potential of combining novel 3D scaffolds with anti-diabetic drugs to enhance DFU 
      treatment, reduce amputation rates, and improve patients' quality of life. While 
      promising, further clinical research is required to validate these emerging 
      therapies and optimize their clinical application.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The use of technologies in the health field has progressively 
      increased. Within the context of a broader project funded by the Italian Ministry 
      of Health (TELEMECHRON study), a randomised controlled trial (RCT) has been 
      conducted in the Autonomous Province of Trento on type 2 diabetes individuals 
      with an untargeted glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) level. METHODS: The overall aim 
      was to evaluate the impact of the ""TreC Diabete"" digital platform, including a 
      smartphone application (app) and a dashboard. This open-label, parallel-group, 
      1:1 allocation ratio RCT in which the intervention group used the app for data 
      entry, symptoms questionnaire, communication with healthcare staff and medication 
      recording, while the control group received standard care. The primary endpoint 
      was change in HbA1c levels at 12 months between groups. RESULTS: Between December 
      2022 and August 2023, 103 participants were enrolled (51 intervention; 52 
      control), with a median age of 67 years old, time from diabetes diagnosis to 
      enrolment 13 years, and 72% male. At 12 months, the median change in HbA1c levels 
      did not differ significantly between groups. Regarding app usage, data entries 
      decreased significantly from the first quarter to the second quarter but 
      subsequently stabilised (p = 0.001). System usability (from 42 responders in the 
      intervention group) had a median score of 95 (range: 0-100), indicating a high 
      level of satisfaction with the platform. DISCUSSION: The study faced several 
      challenges, including platform technical issues, service interruption, data entry 
      anomalies and difficulties in participant recruitment. Study generalisability may 
      be limited by the sample's demographics, as the trial predominantly included 
      younger male individuals with a specific HbA1c level. CONCLUSION: The study 
      highlighted key factors for future implementations, including understanding 
      technology benefits, addressing adoption barriers, and providing education and 
      support to both patients and healthcare providers.

AB  - Objectives: This study aims to determine the relationship between social media 
      use, healthy lifestyle behaviors, and metabolic parameters in adolescents with 
      Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Methods: The study was conducted with descriptive and 
      cross-sectional design, andwas carried out on 108 adolescents, aged 11-18, who 
      were diagnosed with T1D mellitus (T1DM) via Google Form. An adolescent 
      descriptive information form, the Scale of Social Media Use Purposes (SSMUP), the 
      Social Media Addiction Scale (SMAS), and the Adolescent Lifestyle Profile (ALP) 
      were used in the study. The data were analyzed using descriptive statistics such 
      as number, percentage, mean and standard deviation (SD), and statistical methods 
      such as t-tests and Pearson correlation analysis. Findings: The results of the 
      study indicated that social media addiction is significantly related to 
      adolescents' interpersonal relationships and metabolic parameters, while the 
      purposes of social media use are positively associated with physical activity, 
      healthy eating, and interpersonal relationships. Conclusions: Nurses should 
      closely maintain vigilant oversight of social media use and interpersonal 
      communication among adolescents with chronic diseases, create social media 
      content appropriate for diabetes management, and organize trainings on the 
      effects of social media use.

TI  - Associations Between Novel Lipid Indicators and the Risk of Nonalcoholic Fatty 
      Liver Disease in Patients With Type 2 Diabetes.
LID - 10.1002/lipd.12453 [doi]
AB  - This study aimed to evaluate associations between emerging lipid parameters, 
      including the ZJU index (ZJU), the hepatic steatosis index (HSI), the 
      triglyceride-glucose index (TyG), the Framingham steatosis index (FSI) and the 
      atherogenic index of plasma (AIP), and nonalcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) 
      risk in individuals with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and assess their 
      clinical utility for NAFLD prevention and diabetes management. Clinical data from 
      6378 participants were analyzed. Stepwise-adjusted multivariable logistic 
      regression, restricted cubic splines (RCS), subgroup analysis, and sensitivity 
      tests examined relationships between lipid parameters and NAFLD. Receiver 
      operating characteristic (ROC) curves compared predictive performance. Among 
      participants, 36.11% (2303/6378) had NAFLD. After full adjustment, each 1-unit 
      increase in ZJU, HSI, TyG, FSI, and AIP conferred NAFLD odds ratios (95% CI) of 
      1.22 (1.14-1.31), 1.08 (1.05-1.11), 2.19 (1.82-2.63), 1.01 (1.00-1.02), and 4.75 
      (2.97-7.58), respectively. When divided into quartiles, the highest quartile of 
      these parameters exhibited 2.13-fold, 2.86-fold, 2.04-fold, 1.80-fold, and 
      1.68-fold NAFLD risk compared to the lowest quartile. RCS revealed significant 
      nonlinear relationships (p(overall) < 0.001, p(nonlinear) < 0.05). Sensitivity 
      analysis confirmed robustness. ROC curves identified HSI as the strongest 
      predictor (AUC = 0.709, 95% CI: 0.696-0.721). Elevated ZJU, HSI, TyG, FSI, and 
      AIP were significantly associated with increased NAFLD risk in the T2DM 
      population. HSI may demonstrate superior predictive performance for NAFLD in T2DM 
      populations compared to other conventional lipid parameters.

TI  - Efficacy and safety of combination therapy using SGLT2 and DPP4 inhibitors to 
      treat type 2 diabetes: An updated systematic review and meta-analysis with focus 
      on an Asian subpopulation.
LID - 10.1111/dom.16550 [doi]
AB  - AIMS: This updated meta-analysis investigates the efficacy and safety of 
      combining sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 inhibitors (SGLT2is) with dipeptidyl 
      peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP4is) in treating type 2 diabetes (T2D), especially in 
      Asian subpopulations. MATERIALS AND METHODS: A systematic review was conducted on 
      randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published through January 2024 that compared 
      SGLT2i/DPP4i combination therapy with DPP4i or SGLT2i monotherapy. The primary 
      outcome was haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) changes. Subgroup analyses were conducted 
      based on the baseline HbA1c level (using 8.0%-8.5% as the cut-off) and racial 
      groups (Asian vs. non-Asian). RESULTS: This analysis included 17 RCTs with 7588 
      participants. Compared to DPP4i, the SGLT2i/DPP4i combination significantly 
      reduced HbA1c (mean difference [MD] -0.57%, 95% confidence interval [CI] -0.67 to 
      -0.46%), while promoting modest weight loss (MD -1.57 kg, 95% CI -1.93 to 
      -1.20 kg). When compared to SGLT2i, SGLT2i/DPP4i promoted further reductions in 
      HbA1c (MD -0.46%, 95% CI -0.55 to -0.38%) with no significant effects on body 
      weight. Subgroup analyses revealed that the efficacy of adding DPP4i in reducing 
      HbA1c was more pronounced in Asian participants (MD -0.55%, 95% CI -0.71 to 
      -0.39) than in non-Asian participants (MD -0.38%, 95% CI -0.46 to -0.31). The 
      combination therapy was associated with a similar risk of hypoglycaemia compared 
      to both monotherapy groups, with no statistically significant differences 
      observed. CONCLUSIONS: Combination therapy of SGLT2i and DPP4i improves glycaemic 
      control in T2D, with enhanced DPP4i efficacy noted in Asian populations, 
      highlighting its role in personalized diabetes management for these patients.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To document the effectiveness of diabetes distress (DD) interventions 
      and to suggest how the improvements in DD, documented in a previous report, led 
      to improved glycemic outcomes. METHODS: Individuals with T1D (n = 276) with 
      elevated DD (>2 on T1 Diabetes Distress Scale) and HbA1c (>7.5 %) were assigned 
      to: (1) StreamLine, a diabetes self-management program; (2) TunedIn, an ACT-based 
      (Acceptance and Commitment Therapy), emotion-focused DD program; or (3) FixIt, an 
      integration of Streamline and TunedIn. Previous research had shown reduced DD 
      (Stage 1) and improved glycemic outcomes (Stage 4) from baseline to 12-months. 
      Here we assess two intermediate stages: adoption of a new emotional perspective 
      (Stage 2) and improvements in diabetes-related problem solving (Stage 3). A 
      structural equation model was specified to evaluate a hypothesized, 4-stage model 
      of change. RESULTS: Improvements occurred in all three interventions at all 4 
      stages. TunedIn and FixIt, however, compared to StreamLine, displayed greater 
      improvements in Stages 1 through 3; while StreamLine and TunedIn displayed 
      greater improvements in glycemic outcomes than FixIt. Associations between 
      reductions in DD and glycemic change were explained through improvements in 
      emotional perspective taking and problem solving. CONCLUSION: Although all three 
      intervention groups showed improvement, TunedIn demonstrated the most 
      comprehensive benefits. Findings indicate how reductions in diabetes distress, 
      documented in a previous report, are linked with improved glycemic outcomes 
      through changes in emotional perspective-taking, which then allow for improved 
      diabetes-related problem solving. This sequence can form the basis for designing 
      effective intervention programs to reduce DD and improve overall diabetes 
      management.

AB  - CONTEXT: Achieving inpatient glycemic control in patients who are nil per os 
      (NPO), on enteral tube feeds (TF), or total parental nutrition (TPN) remains 
      extremely challenging. OBJECTIVE: To determine if, for inpatients with 
      hyperglycemia who are NPO, on TF, or on TPN, an automated self-adjusting 
      subcutaneous rapid acting insulin algorithm (SQIA) we developed and programmed 
      into the EMR leads to improvements in glucose control compared to conventional 
      insulin treatment (CI).Design/Intervention/Setting/PatientsRetrospective cohort 
      study using EMR data from 9/3/2020 to 9/2/2023, of all adult inpatients, 
      comparing point-of-care (POC) glucose measurements between patients on SQIA 
      versus CI and either NPO, or on TF, or on TPN. The analysis looked at the 
      proportion of q4 hour POC glucose levels in the following ranges: hypoglycemia 
      (<70 mg/dL), in range (71-180 mg/dL), moderate hyperglycemia (181-250 mg/dL), and 
      severe hyperglycemia (>250 mg/dL). RESULTS: There were 5,031 intervals 
      (associated with 4310 hospitalizations) in which the patient was NPO or on TF or 
      TPN and on the SQIA (73.5%) or CI (26.5%). The proportion of glucose values in 
      the hypoglycemic and severely hyperglycemic ranges were significantly lower in 
      the SQIA group vs. the CI group (hypoglycemia: 0.65% vs. 1.10%; difference 
      -0.45%; -0.62 to -0.28%; p < 0.001; hyperglycemia: 5.40% vs. 6.65%; difference 
      -1.25%; -2.03% to -0.46%; p = 0.002). With glucocorticoids, rates of severe 
      hyperglycemia were lower for patients on the SQIA, particularly those receiving 
      high-dose glucocorticoids (11.1% lower). CONCLUSIONS: Patients had a lower 
      proportion of both hypoglycemic and severely hyperglycemic measurements when 
      their blood glucose levels were managed using the SQIA than when managed using 
      conventional physician-driven insulin orders.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: To explore prescription patterns of SGLT2 inhibitors (SGLT2i) and 
      GLP-1 receptor agonists (GLP-1RA) in older adults with type 2 diabetes (T2DM), 
      analyzing age and sex differences. DESIGN: Observational retrospective study. 
      SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Data from 103,820 patients aged 60 to 90 years from 518 
      diabetes centers in Germany, collected between 2017 and 2022 via the DPV 
      registry. METHODS: Patients with at least 3 months' T2DM diagnosis were included. 
      Treatment trends were analyzed using regression models adjusted for age and sex. 
      Repeated measures were aggregated annually. RESULTS: Between 2017 and 2022, 
      SGLT2i use rose from 7.3% to 27.4% and GLP-1RA use from 3.4% to 13.8%. Metformin 
      use increased, while sulfonylureas declined. SGLT2i use was lower in women across 
      all age groups. GLP-1RAs use increased more in younger patients. CONCLUSIONS AND 
      IMPLICATIONS: Newer antidiabetic drugs are increasingly prescribed in older 
      adults, but notable disparities by age and gender persist. These findings suggest 
      the need to address potential biases and barriers to optimize equitable care in 
      geriatric diabetes management.

TI  - Self-care practices and associated factors among type 2 diabetes mellitus 
      patients attending public hospitals in Bale zone, Oromia region, Ethiopia.
PG  - e19529

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition characterized by elevated 
      blood sugar levels. Effective self-care, including medication management, dietary 
      changes, exercise, regular blood sugar monitoring, education and support, stress 
      management, regular healthcare visits, foot care, and sleep hygiene, is essential 
      for its management. OBJECTIVE: The study aimed to gather data on how well 
      patients managed their diabetes through self-care activities, which are crucial 
      for maintaining optimal health outcomes. METHODS: A cross-sectional study was 
      conducted in public hospitals in the Bale zone of Ethiopia from February 5 to 
      March 22, 2024. Using systematic random sampling, 411 patients over 18 with type 
      2 diabetes were selected. Data were collected via interviewer-administered 
      questionnaires, entered into Kobotoolbox, and analyzed using SPSS version 26. 
      Choosing all existing public hospitals in Bale Zone provided comprehensive 
      insights into type 2 diabetes management while adhering to ethical standards, 
      ensuring participant protection and enhanced research credibility through valid 
      instruments designed for accurate data collection. RESULTS: In this study, 59.4% 
      of the 411 participants demonstrated satisfactory diabetes self-care practices, 
      while 40.6% exhibited inadequate practices. Significant factors influencing 
      self-care included higher income (adjusted odds ratio (AOR): 2.39, 95% confidence 
      interval (CI) [1.19-4.80], P < 0.014), private sector employment (AOR: 2.09, 95% 
      CI [1.06-4.13], P < 0.033), receiving diabetic education (AOR: 2.85, 95% CI 
      [1.33-6.12], P < 0.007), membership in a diabetic association (AOR: 1.85, 95% CI 
      [0.93-3.67], P < 0.077), possessing good self-care knowledge (AOR: 2.04, 95% CI 
      [1.24-3.34], P < 0.004), and having no diabetic complications (AOR: 2.68, 95% CI 
      [1.64-4.36], P < 0.000). CONCLUSION: Diabetes self-care practices among type 2 
      diabetes patients in Bale, Ethiopia, are not sufficient. These practices are 
      affected by several factors, such as socioeconomic status, access to diabetes 
      education, membership in diabetes associations, and overall knowledge about 
      self-care. Targeted support and education are crucial for individuals with lower 
      incomes and those in non-private jobs. Enhancing access to diabetic education and 
      promoting membership in diabetic associations can significantly improve self-care 
      practices. Furthermore, it is essential to focus on knowledge enhancement and 
      preventive care for complications during public hospital follow-ups in the Bale 
      Zone.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes is a metabolic disease that can lead to severe 
      cardiovascular diseases and neuropathy. The associated medical costs and 
      complications make timely and effective management particularly important. 
      Traditional diagnostic and management methods, like frequent glucose sampling and 
      insulin injections, impose physical injuries on subjects. The development of 
      artificial intelligence (AI) has opened new opportunities for diabetes 
      management. METHODS: We conducted a meta-analysis integrating existing research, 
      identifying a total of 1156 subjects to assess the effectiveness and safety of 
      AI-based wearable devices, specifically closed-loop insulin delivery systems, in 
      diabetes treatment. RESULTS: Compared to standard controls, AI-based closed-loop 
      systems can analyze glucose data in real-time and automatically adjust insulin 
      delivery, resulting in reduced time outside target glucose ranges (SMD = 0.90, 
      95% CI = 0.69 to 1.10, I(2) = 58%, P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: AI-based closed-loop 
      systems enhance the precision and convenience of diabetes treatment. This 
      meta-analysis providing essential references for clinical treatment and 
      policymaking in diabetes care.

TI  - [Effect of nonsurgical periodontal therapy on glycemic control in type 2 diabetes 
      patients with chronic periodontitis].
PG  - 202-207
AB  - PURPOSE: To investigate the effect of nonsurgical periodontal therapy on blood 
      glucose control in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and chronic 
      periodontitis, as well as the sensitive population. METHODS: A total of 120 
      patients with T2DM and chronic periodontitis who were admitted to the Department 
      of Endocrinology at Lishui City People's Hospital from March 2022 to March 2023 
      were randomly divided into experimental group and control group, with 60 patients 
      in each group. All patients received oral health education, and their general 
      information, community periodontal index (CPI), attachment loss (AL), fasting 
      plasma glucose (FPG), and haemoglobin A1c (HbA1c) were collected. The 
      experimental group received periodontal scaling and root planing. Three months 
      later, CPI, AL, FPG, and HbA1c were measured. Stata 15.0 software was used for 
      statistical analysis. RESULTS: After periodontal scaling and root planing, the 
      CPI, FPG, and HbA1c in the experimental group were significantly lower than those 
      before treatment(P＜0.01) and those in the control group(P＜0.05). AL in the 
      experimental group was also significantly lower than before treatment(P＜0.05) and 
      the control group (P＜0.05). The change of FPG after treatment was positively 
      correlated with the duration of diabetes (P＜0.01) and the baseline CPI(P＜0.05), 
      but negatively correlated with whether suffering from hypertension(P＜0.05). It 
      was also negatively correlated with the FPG level before treatment (P＜0.01). The 
      change of HbA1c after treatment was positively correlated with the duration of 
      diabetes(P＜0.05) and negatively correlated with the HbA1c level before 
      treatment(P＜0.01). CONCLUSIONS: Nonsurgical periodontal therapy is helpful to 
      blood sugar control of type 2 diabetes patients with periodontitis. Patients with 
      higher baseline CPI levels and longer disease durations show greater improvement 
      in glycemic control after treatment.

TI  - Quality of hospital and follow-up care among patients with type 2 diabetes and 
      newly diagnosed cardiovascular disease: a cohort study in Sweden.
PG  - e096633

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To examine hospital discharge practices, including clinical and 
      laboratory assessments, in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) 
      following their first hospitalisation for cardiovascular disease (CVD), and to 
      explore the association of these practices with adverse events, defined as 
      hospital readmission, emergency department visits and mortality. DESIGN: 
      Retrospective cohort study. SETTING: Follow-up for 100 days after a newly 
      diagnosed CVD among patients with T2DM in Region Halland, Sweden. PARTICIPANT: A 
      total of 1482 patients with T2DM and a new diagnosis of CVD during 
      hospitalisation were included. Patients were followed from hospital discharge for 
      up to 100 days. Inclusion criteria were a hospital discharge diagnosis of CVD and 
      a prior diagnosis of T2DM. Patients with incomplete discharge data or without 
      follow-up records were excluded. PRIMARY AND SECONDARY OUTCOME MEASURES: The 
      primary outcome was the overall risk of serious adverse events after hospital 
      discharge, including mortality, hospital readmission and ED encounters, within 
      100 days of discharge. Secondary outcomes included primary care visits and 
      pharmacotherapy adjustments for CVD and T2DM during the same period. RESULTS: The 
      readmission rate within the study period was 27%, while 86% of patients visited 
      primary care within 100 days after discharge. Cardiovascular pharmacotherapy 
      increased, with beta-blocker usage rising to 73% and statin use reaching 82%. A 
      significant, though modest, increase in pharmacotherapy for T2DM was observed, 
      with metformin use increasing from 53% to 57% (p<0.001). Laboratory test results 
      and clinical measurements at discharge, including missing glycated haemoglobin 
      values (68%) and elevated systolic blood pressures, were associated with modest 
      treatment adjustments at discharge, suggesting potential gaps in discharge 
      practices and documentation. CONCLUSIONS: Despite moderate improvements in 
      postdischarge pharmacotherapy, limited changes in diabetes management suggest 
      room for optimisation. The findings emphasise the need for improved discharge 
      planning and continuity of care. Future research should investigate the effects 
      of standardised discharge protocols on treatment outcomes and readmission rates 
      for this patient group.

TI  - Integrating Mobile Health App Data Into Electronic Medical or Health Record 
      Systems and Its Impact on Health Care Delivery and Patient Health Outcomes: 
      Scoping Review.
PG  - e66650
LID - 10.2196/66650 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Mobile health (mHealth) apps are increasingly being used to capture 
      patient health data, provide information, and guide self-management, with 
      reported improvements in health care service delivery and outcomes. However, the 
      impact of integrating mHealth app data into electronic medical record or 
      electronic health record (EMR/EHR) systems remains underexplored. OBJECTIVE: This 
      study aims to identify what is known about the impact of integrating mHealth app 
      data into EMR/EHR systems on health care delivery and patient outcomes. METHODS: 
      A scoping review was conducted to identify original studies that investigated the 
      integration of patient-facing mHealth app data into EMR/EHR systems and the 
      impact on health care outcomes. The PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Cochrane 
      Library, CINAHL, ProQuest, and PsycINFO databases were searched for papers 
      published between January 2014 and July 2024. Two authors independently screened 
      and extracted data on study characteristics, mHealth app features, details of 
      integration with EMR/EHR systems, and effects on health care delivery and patient 
      outcomes. RESULTS: Nineteen studies with 113,135 participants were included. 
      Among these, 6 were randomized clinical trial studies, 8 were conducted in the 
      United States, 12 occurred in hospital settings, 15 involved adult participants, 
      and 6 targeted diabetes management. Main features of the apps and EMR/EHR systems 
      can be categorized into tracking or recording health data (n=19), app data 
      integrated into EMR/EHR systems (n=19), app data summarized or presented on 
      EMR/EHR interface (n=19), communication with the health care team (n=12), 
      reminders or alerts (n=10), synchronization with other apps or devices (n=8), 
      educational information (n=4), and using existing portal credentials to app 
      access (n=2). Most studies reported benefits of integrating the app and EMR/EHR, 
      such as enhanced patient education and self-management (n=5), real-time data 
      recorded and shared with clinicians (n=4), support for clinical decision-making 
      (n=3), improved communication between patients and clinicians (n=7), and improved 
      patient outcomes (n=13). Challenges identified included high drop-off rates in 
      app usage (n=3), limited accessibility due to device restrictions (n=3), 
      incompatibility between mHealth apps and EMR/EHR systems (n=3), increased 
      clinical workload in response to additional information (n=3), data accuracy 
      issues due to network connectivity (n=1), and data security concerns (n=1). 
      CONCLUSIONS: Evidence suggests that the effective integration of mHealth app data 
      into EMR/EHR systems can enhance both clinicians' health care delivery and 
      patients' health outcomes. However, current literature is limited, and future 
      opportunities remain to examine the impact on long-term outcomes, such as 
      mortality, readmissions, and costs, and assess the scalability and sustainability 
      of integration among more broader health conditions and disabilities across 
      diverse health care settings.

TI  - Machine learning-based QSAR and molecular modeling identify promising PTP1B 
      modulators from Ocimum gratissimum for type 2 diabetes therapy.
LID - 10.1007/s11030-025-11255-x [doi]
AB  - Protein tyrosine phosphatase 1B (PTP1B) is a key negative regulator of insulin 
      signaling and a promising therapeutic target for the treatment of type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. Ocimum gratissimum (African basil) has been traditionally used and 
      reported to enhance insulin sensitivity and promote glucose uptake, however, the 
      molecular basis and active constituents responsible for these biological 
      activities remain poorly characterized. The study focused on bioprospecting O. 
      gratissimum for PTP1B inhibitors through machine learning (ML) and molecular 
      modeling. Predictive ML models were developed using a curated IC(50) bioactivity 
      dataset of known PTP1B inhibitors from the ChEMBL database. Among 42 algorithms 
      assessed, the Random Forest Regressor (RFR) exhibited the best performance and 
      identified 49 compounds (pIC(50) > 5) out of 156-screened phytochemicals. 
      Molecular docking and 100-ns molecular dynamics (MD) simulations revealed 
      luteolin, isovitexin, and morin as top binders, forming stable hydrogen bonds and 
      hydrophobic interactions with key catalytic residues (CYS215 and ARG221) of 
      PTP1B. Structural dynamics analysis further revealed the stability and 
      conformational flexibility of the flavonoid-PTP1B complexes, while Molecular 
      Mechanics-Poisson-Boltzmann Surface Area (MM-PBSA) binding free energy 
      calculations supported their strong and favorable binding affinities in a dynamic 
      environment. Overall, these findings suggest that luteolin, isovitexin, and morin 
      may serve as potent, non-covalent PTP1B inhibitors, offering mechanistic insight 
      into the insulin-sensitizing potential of O. gratissimum and supporting its 
      ethnopharmacological use in diabetes management. Further experimental validation 
      is recommended to explore and confirm their therapeutic relevance.

TI  - A smart nanocomposite system for controlled insulin release and glucose sensing 
      in diabetes management.
LID - 10.1039/d5nr01437a [doi]
AB  - Diabetes is a global health challenge, driving the need for novel solutions in 
      glucose monitoring and insulin delivery. Here, we present a next-generation 
      glucose-responsive nanocomposite, ZIF-8@Ins-GOx/AuNCs, designed for simultaneous 
      controlled insulin release and real-time glucose sensing. This dual-functional 
      system synergistically integrates zeolite imidazolate framework-8 (ZIF-8), 
      glucose oxidase (GOx), and gold nanoclusters (AuNCs), creating a highly efficient 
      platform for personalized diabetes management. The nanocomposite exhibits an 
      impressive glucose detection range (2.50-200 mM) with high sensitivity (LOD = 
      0.80 mM), offering unprecedented accuracy for early diagnosis and monitoring. In 
      addition, it demonstrates a glucose-triggered insulin release profile with 
      exceptional encapsulation efficiency (90%) and sustained release under 
      hyperglycemic conditions. Comprehensive in vitro studies reveal excellent 
      biocompatibility, with cell viability greater than 80% at concentrations up to 
      22.2 mM, highlighting the safety for potential clinical use. This work represents 
      a significant leap forward in the development of adaptive drug delivery systems, 
      offering a versatile, scalable platform with the potential to revolutionize not 
      only diabetes treatment but also broader biomedical applications demanding 
      precise, self-regulated therapeutic interventions.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Managing sudden deafness (SD) in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) 
      is particularly challenging due to the heightened risk of adverse effects 
      associated with systemic drug administration. This study explores the potential 
      of retroauricular subperiosteal injection as a localized drug delivery method for 
      a more effective and safe treatment. AIM: To compare the efficacy of 
      retroauricular subperiosteal injection vs systemic intravenous glucocorticoid 
      (GC) administration for SD in patients with DM and assess the effects on blood 
      glucose levels. METHODS: A total of 128 cases of type 2 DM (T2DM) with SD 
      diagnosed and treated in Zibo Central Hospital from February 2021 to July 2023 
      were divided into two groups: An observation group (66 cases receiving 
      retroauricular subperiosteal injection of methylprednisolone) and a control group 
      (62 cases receiving systemic intravenous administration of methylprednisolone). 
      The two groups were compared in terms of therapeutic efficacy, hearing recovery, 
      blood glucose level changes, and incidence of adverse reactions. Binary logistic 
      regression was used to analyze the factors affecting therapeutic efficacy. 
      RESULTS: The observation group showed a significantly higher total effective rate 
      (90.91%) compared with the control group (75.81%, P < 0.05). Additionally, 
      pure-tone hearing threshold, fasting plasma glucose, and 2-hour postprandial 
      blood glucose were significantly lower in the observation group compared with the 
      control group (P < 0.05). The incidence of adverse reactions was also lower in 
      the observation group than in the control group (7.58% vs 22.58%, P < 0.05). A 
      T2DM course longer than 5 years and systemic intravenous GC administration were 
      identified as independent risk factors for treatment inefficacy (P < 0.05). 
      CONCLUSION: In treating patients with diabetes and SD, retroauricular 
      subperiosteal injection of methylprednisolone offers superior therapeutic 
      efficacy and lower incidence of adverse reactions compared with systemic 
      intravenous GC administration, with minimal impact on blood glucose.

TI  - Therapeutic Potential of Lavandula stoechas Aqueous Extract in Managing Diabetes 
      and Its Complications: Insights From Biochemical and In Silico Studies.
PG  - e70469

AB  - Diabetes mellitus is a chronic metabolic disorder characterized by persistent 
      hyperglycemia, commonly associated with dyslipidemia, oxidative stress, and 
      complications affecting multiple organs, including the kidneys and liver. These 
      complications result from prolonged insulin deficiency or resistance, leading to 
      impaired glucose and lipid metabolism, as well as increased oxidative damage. 
      Effective diabetes management requires not only glycemic control but also 
      addressing associated metabolic and oxidative imbalances. Natural therapies with 
      multi-target actions, such as the aqueous extract of Lavandula stoechas (AqLs), 
      have gained attention for their potential to mitigate both hyperglycemia and 
      related complications. This study investigated the therapeutic efficacy of AqLs 
      in managing diabetes and its complications. The aerial parts of L. stoechas were 
      collected, dried, and prepared using the decoction method. Alloxan-induced 
      diabetic rats received AqLs at doses of 150 mg/kg and 300 mg/kg for 4 weeks. 
      Biochemical parameters, including blood glucose, lipid profiles, liver glycogen, 
      and markers of kidney and liver function, were assessed. In silico ADME and 
      toxicity assessments were performed to examine the pharmacokinetic behavior and 
      safety of the extract's phytochemicals. AqLs significantly reduced blood glucose 
      levels, improved lipid parameters, and prevented body weight loss in diabetic 
      rats. It also enhanced liver glycogen levels and ameliorated markers of kidney 
      and liver dysfunction. In silico analysis showed that compounds such as naringin 
      and syringic acid demonstrated favorable pharmacokinetics and safety, supporting 
      their potential as orally administered therapeutic agents. These findings suggest 
      that L. stoechas aqueous extract exerts significant antihyperglycemic, 
      lipid-lowering, and organ-protective effects, making it a promising natural 
      therapeutic agent for diabetes management.

PG  - 1933-1939
LID - 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1692_24 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Red blood cells combine with blood sugar to form glycosylated 
      hemoglobin. The glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1C) test measures blood sugar control 
      over the past few months and the possibility of complications in the future. AIM: 
      The study aimed to investigate HbA1C characteristics in the population of Jeddah 
      city, and its correlation with body mass index. SETTING: The study was conducted 
      in the Makkah region, Jeddah City, KSA. METHODS: This study was conducted at a 
      university clinic in Jeddah City. HbA1C levels and BMI were measured and 
      calculated for 238 visitors between 2022 and 2023. Three tables were extracted 
      from the analyzed data. The first table shows the age stages of the patients. The 
      second table classifies diabetes stages: non-diabetic, prediabetic, and diabetic. 
      The third table categorizes BMI into normal, overweight, and obesity. RESULTS: 
      The study's findings reveal There was a linear correlation between BMI and HbA1C. 
      (The higher the BMI, the higher the HbA1C). CONCLUSION: In Jeddah City, 
      two-thirds of the population had either diabetes or prediabetes, and most of them 
      were women in their 40s. Most of the population had a high BMI (>80%), was 
      overweight, and had obesity class I (60%). There was a linear relationship 
      between HbA1C and BMI. The young-age group (</=30s) was interested in performing an 
      HbA1C test at a reasonable rate, and most were nondiabetics. CONTRIBUTION: 
      Policymakers should prioritize supporting public health by increasing patient 
      education programs, such as Continuous health education, which is the most 
      effective treatment for diabetes and obesity.

TI  - Exploring the clinical features and complications of type 1 diabetes mellitus in 
      Saudi Arabia: A retrospective analysis.
PG  - 1889-1895
LID - 10.4103/jfmpc.jfmpc_1758_24 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND AIM: On a global scale Type 1 diabetes (T1D) ranks high on the 
      list of most prevalent endocrine metabolic disorders; it affects children and 
      adolescents. Frequently, T1D causes complications that can be serious, acute and 
      chronic. This present study aims to investigate the clinical features and 
      complications associated with T1D in Saudi Arabia. METHODS: In this retrospective 
      cohort study, individuals with T1D were investigated at the Diabetes Treatment 
      Center, Prince Sultan Military Medical City (PSMMC) in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, 
      focusing on patients aged 14 to 60 years. Data were collected on each patient, 
      regarding demographic information (gender, age) and diabetes-related criteria 
      (duration of diabetes, age when diagnosed, current and initial HbA1c values, and 
      treatment modalities). Accurate documentation was done of the disease-related 
      complications such as hypertension, dyslipidemia, and a plethora of diabetic 
      retinopathy (whether non-proliferative, proliferative, or macular edema), plus 
      nephropathy/end-stage renal disease, neuropathy, coronary artery disease, 
      peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. RESULTS: The patient 
      cohort comprises 46.1% males and 53.9% females. Different groups revealed similar 
      biochemical markers, like HbA1c and creatinine clearance. Patients with diabetes 
      for a longer duration had a higher probability of statin intake (P = 0.0001) and 
      GLP-1 therapy (P = 0.004). A striking rise was evident in microalbuminuria and 
      retinopathy, some disease-related complications, with the duration of diabetes. 
      While a few of the complications show higher frequency in patients having HbA1c 
      >7.5%, several differences are noted, although not statistically significant; 
      this is indicative of the complexities in the relationships between diabetes 
      management and the final results. CONCLUSION: In summary, younger patients with a 
      more contracted timespan of diabetes will experience fewer complications than 
      those with a lengthier duration of the disease, who in reality will face higher 
      risks. Therefore, to achieve improved health outcomes, diabetes patients require 
      effective treatment management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) is associated with metabolic and 
      cardiovascular complications. While physical activity and dietary modifications 
      are established interventions, their combined effects in active male populations 
      remain underexplored. OBJECTIVE: To assess the effects of a 12-week therapeutic 
      diet and/or physical activity program on body composition and biochemical 
      parameters in male recreational athletes with T2DM. METHODS: Thirty-six male 
      recreational athletes (aged 30-45 years) with T2DM were randomly assigned to: 
      Physical Activity (PA), Nutritional Regimen (NR), Combined PA and NR (PA+NR), or 
      Control (CG) groups. Body composition (body mass, body fat percentage, muscle 
      mass) and biochemical markers (FBS, HbA1c, LDL-C, HDL-C, HOMA-IR) were measured 
      at baseline, midpoint, and intervention end. RESULTS: The PA+NR group showed 
      significant improvements in body composition: reduced body mass (p<0.05, 
      ES=0.29), reduced body fat percentage (p<0.05, ES=0.31), and increased muscle 
      mass (p<0.05, ES=0.35). This group also demonstrated significant improvements in 
      biochemical markers: reduced FBS (p<0.05, ES=0.17), HbA1c (p<0.05, ES=0.23), 
      LDL-C (p<0.05, ES=0.17), and HOMA-IR (p<0.05, ES=0.39), with increased HDL-C 
      (p<0.05, ES=0.29). The PA group showed only HbA1c reductions, while the NR group 
      primarily improved lipid profiles. No significant changes occurred in the control 
      group. CONCLUSION: A combined therapeutic diet and physical activity program 
      effectively improved body composition and biochemical parameters in recreational 
      athletes with T2DM. This combined approach could be recommended as an integral 
      strategy for diabetes management in physically active individuals.

AB  - Sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 (SGLT2) inhibitors are a class of commonly 
      prescribed medications used in diabetes management for both their cardiovascular 
      and renal benefits. However, as a class, SGLT2 inhibitors have a known side 
      effect risk for ketoacidosis, including the rarer version called euglycemic 
      diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA). We present three cases of euglycemic DKA 
      postoperatively, in patients who were on SGLT2 inhibitors for type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus. A DKA protocol was initiated for all three patients, and after 
      treatment with fluid and insulin therapy, all patients recovered. All three were 
      restarted on their SGLT2 inhibitor upon discharge. Based on this limited 
      experience, we recommend close monitoring of postoperative patients on SGLT2 
      inhibitors to allow early detection of euglycemic DKA. Larger trials are needed 
      to determine the exact, optimal timing of restarting SGLT2 inhibitors 
      postoperatively.

      SGLT 2: A Comprehensive Review.
PG  - e20250012
LID - 10.62958/j.cjap.2025.012 [doi]
AB  - Sotagliflozin, a novel dual inhibitor of sodium-glucose cotransporters 1 and 2 
      (SGLT1/2), represents a promising therapeutic advancement for managing diabetes 
      mellitus. By inhibiting SGLT1 in the small intestine and SGLT2 in the kidneys, 
      sotagliflozin uniquely improves glycemic control through reduced postprandial 
      glucose absorption and enhanced urinary glucose excretion. This dual mechanism 
      has shown significant benefits for both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, including 
      reduced insulin requirements, better glycemic control, weight loss, and improved 
      cardiovascular and renal outcomes. Clinical trials have highlighted its potential 
      to mitigate the risks of diabetic complications such as heart failure and chronic 
      kidney disease. However, its use is associated with some side effects, including 
      gastrointestinal disturbances, urinary tract infections, and an elevated risk of 
      diabetic ketoacidosis. This review explores the chemistry, pharmacology, and 
      therapeutic implications of sotagliflozin, emphasizing its unique dual-target 
      approach and potential to address unmet needs in diabetes management.

AB  - AIMS: Type 2 diabetes has reached pandemic proportions; and obesity is considered 
      one of its main drivers. We investigated the association of weight status with 
      glycemic control, diabetes related complications and anti-hyperglycemic 
      medication use among adults living with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). METHODS: 
      We analysed data from the 2015 to 2022 cross-sectional Australian National 
      Diabetes Audits (ANDA) to explore the association of weight status with glycemic 
      control and diabetes complications. RESULTS: 13,589 adult patients with T2DM 
      (55.7 % male, mean body mass index 33.4 kg/m(2)) were included. 71 % of patients 
      had above-target glycemia (HbA1c > 7 %). Odds of being moderately above target 
      (HbA1c 7.1-9 %) or greatly above target (HbA1c > 9 %) were higher in patients 
      with obesity (OR 1.20, 95 % CI 1.05, 1.37 and OR 1.43 95 % CI 1.22, 1.68 
      respectively). Patients with obesity were more likely to have cardiovascular 
      disease, diabetic foot ulcers and peripheral vascular disease, despite use of a 
      greater number of anti-hyperglycemic drugs. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with T2DM and 
      obesity have poorer glycemic control, higher utilisation of anti-glycemic 
      medications and greater odds of diabetes related complications. Approaches to 
      optimise glycemic control that also deliver weight reduction should be an 
      integral component of diabetes management to help improve health outcomes for 
      people with T2DM.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: The therapeutic advantages of glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor 
      agonists (GLP-1 RAs) in diabetes management have been demonstrated. However, 
      their potential association with autoimmune diseases remains unknown. Using a 
      comprehensive real-world dataset, this study compared GLP-1 RAs against 
      dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (DPP-4is) with respect to the incidence of 
      autoimmune diseases. METHODS: This retrospective cohort study, with an 
      active-comparator and new-user design, analyzed data from the TriNetX US 
      Collaborative Network. We identified 4,841,560 patients aged over 18 years with 
      type 2 diabetes from 1 January 2015 to 31 December 2022. Finally, 412,021 and 
      383,415 patients were included in the GLP-1 RAs and DPP-4is groups, respectively. 
      Propensity score matching was used to balance baseline characteristics, and 
      hazard ratios (HRs) were estimated with Cox regression models over an eight-year 
      follow-up. RESULTS: After propensity score matching, each group included 290,770 
      patients. The analysis revealed that patients receiving GLP-1 RAs exhibited 
      significantly higher risks of certain autoimmune conditions, including ulcerative 
      colitis (HR, 1.11; 95 % CI, 1.04-1.19), rheumatoid arthritis (HR, 1.08; 95 % CI, 
      1.03-1.12), autoimmune thyroiditis (HR, 1.30; 95 % CI, 1.24-1.38), ankylosing 
      spondylitis (HR, 1.30; 95 % CI, 1.13-1.51), and psoriasis (HR, 1.17; 95 % CI, 
      1.12-1.22), compared to those on DPP-4is. Moreover, sensitivity analyses 
      consistently revealed a significant link between GLP-1 RAs use and autoimmune 
      diseases. CONCLUSIONS: This study suggests that compared with DPP-4is, the use of 
      GLP-1 RAs is linked to increased risks of certain autoimmune diseases. Careful 
      monitoring might be required among patients on GLP-1 RAs.

AB  - This study aims to develop a robust and accurate model to forecast 30-day 
      readmissions for patients with diabetes by leveraging machine learning 
      techniques. Diabetes, being a chronic condition with complex care needs, often 
      leads to frequent hospital readmissions. By predicting the likelihood of 
      readmission within this critical timeframe, the study aims to empower healthcare 
      providers to identify high-risk patients and implement targeted interventions 
      proactively. The study utilized a dataset of 352 records from a diabetes 
      specialty clinic in Varanasi, India. The study constructed prediction models 
      utilizing Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost. The 
      models were assessed using precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC. The results 
      demonstrate that XGBoost attained the highest precision (0.84), recall (0.87), 
      and F1-score (0.85), establishing it as the most effective model for predicting 
      30-day readmissions. Nevertheless, the Random Forest model demonstrated a 
      superior AUC-ROC value of 0.94, indicating its ability to detect readmission 
      cases accurately. The study's findings indicate that XGBoost demonstrates 
      superior prediction accuracy, although Random Forest exhibits greater suitability 
      for smaller datasets because of its strength against overfitting. These findings 
      emphasize the significance of carefully choosing and optimizing machine learning 
      models for healthcare applications. The study enhances patient care by allowing 
      healthcare practitioners to identify high-risk patients and conduct focused 
      interventions, potentially lessening the burden of readmissions.

TI  - Contracted or Vanishing Gallbladder: A Case Report.
PG  - e84382
LID - 10.7759/cureus.84382 [doi]
LID - e84382
AB  - A contracted or ""vanishing"" gallbladder is a condition characterized by severe 
      atrophy or fibrosis of the gallbladder, often resulting from chronic 
      inflammation, recurrent cholecystitis, gallstone disease, or metabolic disorders 
      such as diabetes and chronic alcohol use. The etiopathogenesis involves 
      progressive fibrosis due to persistent biliary obstruction, chronic infection, or 
      impaired blood flow, particularly in patients with liver cirrhosis. While the 
      exact incidence remains unclear, it is more prevalent in individuals with 
      long-standing hepatobiliary diseases or metabolic syndromes. Common symptoms 
      include severe right upper quadrant pain, jaundice, nausea, vomiting, and signs 
      of obstructive jaundice, such as dark urine and pale stools. Diagnostic 
      investigations typically involve ultrasound, contrast-enhanced computed 
      tomography (CECT), magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP), and 
      endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP) to assess biliary 
      obstruction, liver pathology, and gallbladder morphology. Treatment requires a 
      multidisciplinary approach, including initial ERCP for biliary decompression, 
      followed by surgical intervention (laparoscopic or open cholecystectomy), with 
      conversion to open surgery often necessary due to dense adhesions and fibrosis. 
      Postoperative care focuses on managing comorbidities, preventing complications, 
      and long-term monitoring of liver health. This case report presents the 
      challenging management of a 34-year-old male with a history of diabetes mellitus, 
      chronic alcohol use, and liver cirrhosis, who presented with severe right upper 
      quadrant pain, jaundice, and ascites. Initial evaluation revealed cholangitis, 
      calculous cholecystitis with choledocholithiasis, and imaging findings consistent 
      with liver cirrhosis. The patient underwent ERCP for biliary stenting and sludge 
      extraction, followed by an attempted laparoscopic cholecystectomy. 
      Intraoperatively, dense adhesions and fibrosis obscured the gallbladder, 
      confirming a contracted or ""vanishing"" gallbladder, prompting conversion to an 
      open procedure. The case highlights the diagnostic complexities of contracted 
      gallbladders, which often result from chronic inflammation, fibrosis, or 
      metabolic disorders. Preoperative imaging, including ultrasound and MRCP, played 
      a critical role in identifying biliary obstruction and liver pathology. However, 
      intraoperative findings necessitated adaptive surgical decision-making to 
      mitigate risks such as bile duct injury or hemorrhage. The patient's multiple 
      comorbidities further complicated management, emphasizing the need for a 
      multidisciplinary approach involving gastroenterologists, surgeons, and 
      hepatologists. Postoperative recovery was closely monitored for complications, 
      including infection and bile leaks. The patient was discharged with follow-up 
      care focusing on liver health, diabetes management, and alcohol cessation. This 
      report underscores the importance of thorough preoperative assessment, 
      flexibility in surgical technique, and collaborative care in optimizing outcomes 
      for patients with complex gallbladder pathology. Future research should explore 
      long-term outcomes and improved imaging techniques to enhance surgical planning 
      for such challenging cases.

AB  - This study investigates the inhibitory potential of four 
      glucosinolates-glucoerucin, glucoiberin, gluconasturtiin, and 
      glucotropaeolin-isolated from watercress (Nasturtium officinale) against Protein 
      Tyrosine Phosphatase 1B (PTP1B), a key regulator of insulin signaling. Molecular 
      docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and MM/PBSA free energy 
      calculations identified glucoerucin (-17.18 +/- 3.51 kcal/mol) and gluconasturtiin 
      (-13.54 +/- 1.79 kcal/mol) as the strongest binders, with stable interactions 
      involving Phe280 and Phe196 through pi-pi stacking. Potential Energy Landscape 
      (PEL) analysis further confirmed that these two compounds occupied the most 
      stable low-energy conformational states, reinforcing their favorable binding to 
      PTP1B. In vitro enzyme inhibition assays provided experimental validation that 
      glucoerucin (IC(5)(0) = 6.07 +/- 0.69 microM) and gluconasturtiin (IC(5)(0) = 7.65 +/- 0.45 microM) 
      demonstrated the strongest inhibitory effects, comparable to ursolic acid 
      (IC(5)(0) = 7.11 +/- 0.95 microM). Enzyme kinetics revealed a non-competitive inhibition 
      mechanism, with K(i) values of 6.29 microM and 7.02 microM, suggesting allosteric 
      regulation. ADMET analysis indicated good solubility and metabolic stability but 
      limited oral bioavailability due to low gastrointestinal (GI) absorption. These 
      findings highlight glucoerucin and gluconasturtiin as promising natural PTP1B 
      inhibitors, warranting further optimization for therapeutic applications in type 
      2 diabetes management.

LID - S0736-4679(25)00051-4 [pii]
LID - 10.1016/j.jemermed.2025.02.018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Combination therapy with metformin and sodium-glucose cotransporter 2 
      (SGLT2) inhibitors is strongly recommended for adults with type 2 diabetes 
      mellitus who have inadequate glycemic control. These inhibitors are particularly 
      indicated for patients with a history or high risk of atherosclerotic 
      cardiovascular disease, heart failure, or chronic kidney disease. Consequently, 
      the number of patients receiving both metformin and SGLT2 inhibitors is expected 
      to increase. However, these treatments pose a risk of life-threatening acidoses, 
      specifically metformin-associated lactic acidosis (MALA) and euglycemic diabetic 
      ketoacidosis (euDKA), which require prompt differentiation and distinct 
      treatments. CASE REPORT: We present the case of a woman in her 50s with chronic 
      heart failure who had been treated for type 2 diabetes for 15 years. After 
      dehydration caused by working in hot conditions and fluid restriction, she 
      presented with dehydration, fatigue, respiratory distress, hypotension, 
      tachypnea, hypothermia, acute renal failure, hypoglycemia, and severe metabolic 
      acidosis. Despite supportive care, lactic acidosis persisted, leading to a 
      diagnosis of MALA. Hemodialysis improved lactate levels, but a persistent anion 
      gap and elevated beta-hydroxybutyrate level confirmed euDKA. Metabolic abnormalities 
      resolved with continuous insulin infusion and the patient was discharged without 
      sequelae. WHY SHOULD AN EMERGENCY PHYSICIAN BE AWARE OF THIS?: The combination of 
      MALA and euDKA represents rare but potentially fatal conditions requiring 
      distinct diagnostic and therapeutic approaches. With their growing use for type 2 
      diabetes management and cardiovascular/kidney benefits, emergency physicians are 
      more likely to encounter complications associated with these medications.

AB  - Controlling weight and cardiovascular risk factors is paramount in type 2 
      diabetes management; however, the definition and feasibility of remission warrant 
      closer examination. Type 2 diabetes remission, typically attained through weight 
      loss, appears to be a temporary state based on the 2021 consensus definition, 
      with most individuals experiencing weight regain and relapse of the condition. 
      Although sustained type 2 diabetes remission is possible for some individuals and 
      is associated with improved quality of life and reduced risk for microvascular 
      and macrovascular complications, no conclusive evidence exists to show that 
      achieving normoglycaemia and substantial weight loss without glucose-lowering 
      medications is more beneficial than with them. Sustained control of 
      hyperglycaemia, along with reducing adiposity-whether through surgical, medical, 
      or lifestyle interventions-could be more relevant than remission itself. Herein, 
      we assess current remission paradigms, emphasising the discordance among 
      definitions and the need for approaches that better align with clinical realities 
      and patient needs.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The number of older patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D) is 
      increasing, and effective self-management is crucial for controlling disease 
      progression and its complications. OBJECTIVE: We designed a home telemedicine 
      intervention that combines telemedicine with health education based on the Health 
      Belief Model (HBM). This study evaluated its effectiveness on self-management in 
      older patients with T2D. METHODS: Between March and April 2022, we recruited 198 
      community-dwelling patients with T2D aged 65 years and older. Patients were 
      randomly assigned to either a control group, which received a conventional 
      diabetes management program, or an intervention group, which received a home 
      telemedicine intervention with a health education program based on the HBM. The 
      intervention lasted 6 months. The primary outcome measured was glycosylated 
      hemoglobin (HbA1c); secondary outcomes included diabetes self-management 
      capacity, self-efficacy, and health beliefs. We collected outcome metrics at 
      baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Generalized estimating equations were used to 
      compare changes in outcomes. RESULTS: A total of 96.5% (191/198) of patients 
      completed the study. From baseline to 6 months, HbA1c decreased by mean -0.99% 
      (95% CI -1.60% to -0.60%) in the intervention group and mean -0.42% (95% CI 
      -0.90% to 0.90%) in the control group. The intervention group experienced a 
      significantly greater reduction of 0.42% compared to the control group (95% CI 
      0.12%-0.73%). Furthermore, compared to the control group, the intervention group 
      showed significant improvements in diabetes self-management skills (mean 5.88, 
      95% CI 4.98-6.79), self-efficacy (mean 9.40, 95% CI 8.15-10.66), and health 
      beliefs (mean 19.54, 95% CI 17.71-21.36) at both 3 and 6 months. CONCLUSIONS: 
      Home telemedicine interventions incorporating health education based on the HBM 
      can provide significant benefits for community-dwelling older patients with T2D, 
      potentially offering new avenues for chronic disease prevention and management. 
      However, future large-scale studies are required to further assess their 
      effectiveness and feasibility.

TI  - Model rural health research units in India: A research priority setting exercise.
PG  - 337-345
LID - 10.25259/IJMR_2157_2024 [pii]
AB  - Background & Objectives Research in rural health has historically been 
      opportunistic, lacking alignment with strategic goals or community needs. The 
      Government of India established Model Rural Health Research Units (MRHRUs) to 
      address these disparities through targeted research. However, inconsistent 
      outputs highlight the need for a strategic research agenda. Identifying research 
      priorities is critical to inform policy and funding strategies of MRHRUs. Methods 
      A nationwide Research Priority Setting (RPS) exercise was conducted, involving 
      120 respondents for free listing of questions, and 250 for ranking. Respondents 
      from various stakeholder groups, including policymakers, researchers, and 
      community representatives, participated. Research priorities were categorised 
      into three domains - Description, Development, and Delivery. An iterative process 
      was employed to refine and consolidate the 122 research questions into 36, which 
      were subsequently ranked using a scoring system that assessed their importance, 
      feasibility, and impact. The list of priorities was finalised through stakeholder 
      deliberation. Results The top five research priorities across the three domains 
      addressing key rural health challenges as identified in this study are presented. 
      'Descriptive' priorities included investigating social determinants of 
      hypertension, medicine supply chain bottlenecks, and mental health in the 
      elderly. 'Development' priorities focused on interventions using electronic 
      health records in hospitals, tuberculosis control, and menstrual hygiene 
      education. 'Delivery' priorities emphasised improving healthcare resilience, 
      emergency care, and technology-driven diabetes management. These priorities were 
      disseminated to MRHRU managers and policymakers to guide decisions with regard to 
      perceived priorities for research in rural health. Interpretation & conclusions 
      This first-of-its-kind RPS exercise provides inputs towards a strategic roadmap 
      for rural health research, ensuring that future studies align with the needs of 
      rural populations, leading to improved health outcomes. These findings illustrate 
      perceptions and priorities of a selection of respondents from different 
      stakeholder groups and need to be taken into consideration by the Department of 
      Health Research and at the local level by each of the MRHRUs.

AB  - This study examines the weight-related discourses in holiday advertising for 
      Ozempic, a prescription drug originally developed for diabetes management but now 
      widely marketed for weight loss. Sponsored Facebook advertisements for Ozempic 
      were collected throughout December 2024, with 12 ads analyzed through Foucauldian 
      discourse analysis. This analysis identifies three interrelated discursive 
      constructs: (1) Santa Takes Ozempic, (2) Ozempic as the Perfect Holiday Gift, and 
      (3) Medical Authority Meets Holiday Cheer. These advertisements use cultural 
      symbols like Santa Claus and New Year's resolutions messaging to (re)produce 
      dominant and contested discourses about fatness and weight loss, while 
      constructing pharmaceutical intervention as both a necessity and a gift. The 
      analysis highlights how these marketing strategies mobilize biopower, construct 
      self-surveillance as normative, and contribute to the commodification of health, 
      reinforcing weight stigma under the guise of holiday celebration.

AB  - PURPOSE: To examine the association between dietary fiber intake and mortality 
      risks (all-cause and cardiovascular) among U.S. adults with diabetes or 
      prediabetes, and to evaluate the dose-response patterns of these associations. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: This longitudinal cohort study analyzed data from 3259 
      adults with diabetes or prediabetes from the 2011-2018 National Health and 
      Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Dietary fiber intake was assessed using 
      two 24-hour dietary recall interviews. Mortality data were obtained through 
      December 31, 2019. Multiple Cox proportional hazards models were used to evaluate 
      associations between fiber intake and mortality outcomes, adjusting for 
      demographic and health-related covariates. RESULTS: Higher dietary fiber intake 
      was significantly associated with reduced all-cause mortality risk (HR = 0.98, 
      95% CI: 0.97-0.99, P = 0.0039). For cardiovascular mortality, a non-linear 
      relationship was identified with a threshold at 26.2 g/day. Below this threshold, 
      each gram increase in fiber intake was associated with a 3% reduction in 
      cardiovascular mortality risk (HR = 0.97, 95% CI: 0.94-0.99, P = 0.0352), while 
      no significant benefit was observed above this threshold. CONCLUSIONS: Dietary 
      fiber intake shows a protective effect against all-cause mortality in U.S. adults 
      with diabetes or prediabetes. For cardiovascular mortality, moderate fiber intake 
      up to 26.2 g/day appears beneficial, while higher intake may not provide 
      additional cardiovascular benefits. These findings provide important evidence for 
      developing targeted dietary recommendations in diabetes management.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Diabetes mellitus, a global health concern with severe complications, 
      demands early detection and precise staging for effective management. Machine 
      learning approaches, combined with bioinformatics, offer promising avenues for 
      enhancing diagnostic accuracy and identifying key biomarkers. METHODS: This study 
      employed a multi-class classification framework to classify patients across four 
      health states: healthy, prediabetes, type 2 Diabetes Mellitus (T2DM) without 
      complications, and T2DM with complications. Three models were developed using 
      molecular markers, biochemical markers, and a combined model of both. Five 
      machine learning classifiers were applied: Random Forest (RF), Extra Tree 
      Classifier, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis, Naive Bayes, and Light Gradient 
      Boosting Machine. To improve the robustness and precision of the classification, 
      Recursive Feature Elimination with Cross-Validation (RFECV) and a fivefold 
      cross-validation were used. The multi-class classification approach enabled 
      effective discrimination between the four diabetes stages. RESULTS: The top 
      contributing features identified for the combined model through RFECV included 
      three molecular markers-miR342, NFKB1, and miR636-and two biochemical markers the 
      albumin-to-creatinine ratio and HDLc, indicating their strong association with 
      diabetes progression. The Extra Trees Classifier achieved the highest performance 
      across all models, with an AUC value of 0.9985 (95% CI: [0.994-1.000]). This 
      classifier outperformed other models, demonstrating its robustness and 
      applicability for precise diabetes staging. CONCLUSION: These findings underscore 
      the value of integrating machine learning with molecular and biochemical markers 
      for the accurate classification of diabetes stages, supporting a potential shift 
      toward more personalized diabetes management.

TI  - Caffeine and Sports Performance: The Conflict between Caffeine Intake to Enhance 
      Performance and Avoiding Caffeine to Ensure Sleep Quality.
LID - 10.1007/s40279-025-02245-y [doi]
AB  - The ergogenic effects of caffeine have been reported in scientific literature 
      over a wide spectrum of sporting activities. The current recommendation for 
      caffeine supplementation is ingesting ~ 3-6 mg/kg about 1 h before the onset of 
      exercise. However, some studies reporting caffeine-induced ergogenic effects 
      during exercise have also reported increased activation and reduced sleep quality 
      in the hours after caffeine ingestion. While most of the research on caffeine 
      supplementation for sporting activities recommends the consumption of this 
      stimulant to enhance performance, research focusing on athletes' sleep quality 
      advises against this decision, especially before competition in the evening or 
      later. Considering that some athletes often compete in the evening or later, the 
      general recommendation of caffeine supplementation may be modified for these 
      athletes as acute caffeine intake in these conditions may produce undesirable 
      side effects such as insomnia and, potentially, reduced performance in subsequent 
      days. In this review, we examine literature on this topic to help athletes and 
      sports practitioners solve the dilemma between the convenience of using caffeine 
      to enhance sports performance or avoiding caffeine to ensure sleep quality. This 
      review identifies potential solutions for this decision, keeping the focus on 
      athletes' well-being. Overall, the performance response to caffeine and the 
      effect of this substance on sleep quality can vary interindividually and depend 
      on the conditions of the exercise session (time of onset, duration, etc.). For 
      this reason, nutritional practitioners should assess their athletes individually 
      to resolve the conflict between caffeine ingestion and ensuring sleep quality on 
      an individual basis, using simulated competitions with dual measurement of 
      performance during exercise and unwanted effects in the following hours. In 
      addition, the dose, timing, and source of caffeine supplementation can be 
      individually adjusted to obtain performance benefits while reducing side effects 
      for athletes ingesting caffeine before evening sporting events.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Carpal tunnel syndrome (CTS) patients experience a wide range of 
      sleep complaints. However, little evidence exists on how conservative treatment 
      can improve sleep quality in these patients. PURPOSE: To determine the 
      effectiveness of a multimodal physiotherapy approach based on sleep symptoms and 
      quality in patients suffering from CTS included in a surgery waiting list. STUDY 
      DESIGN: A randomized controlled trial. METHODS: CTS patients included in surgical 
      waiting list of Spanish Public Health System were recruited. Patients were 
      randomized into an education, diacutaneous fibrolysis, and self-mobilization 
      treatment over 3 weeks (n = 20) or a control group (n = 22). Nocturnal symptoms, 
      Medical Outcome Study Sleep Scale, Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire, and 
      sensitivity of the hand were assessed after treatment, at 3- and 6-months 
      follow-up. A general linear model of repeated measures was performed. RESULTS: 
      Nocturnal symptoms (p < 0.1; d = 1.0-1.5) and Boston Carpal Tunnel Questionnaire 
      (p = 0.01; d = 1.0-1.1) were improved in favor of intervention group at each 
      follow-up. Also, sensitivity of the first three fingers showed better results for 
      intervention group at 3- (p = 0.021; d = 0.5) and 6-months (p = 0.036; d = 0.8) 
      follow-up. Five of the eight items in the Medical Outcome Study Sleep Scale 
      reported significant differences at 6-month against the control group (p < 0.1). 
      There was a significant increase in the amount of sleep in the intervention group 
      (p = 0.006; d = 0.7). Finally, physical activity and splint influenced the 
      results of nocturnal symptoms and awaken short of breath and headache. 
      CONCLUSIONS: Education, diacutaneous fibrolysis, and self-mobilization may 
      improve night-time symptoms and sleep quality in CTS patients awaiting surgery. 
      Patients included were mainly severe, had associated comorbidities, 
      and under-represented patients in conservative treatment studies.

TI  - DTI-Derived Evaluation of Glymphatic System Function in Veterans with Chronic 
      Multisymptom Illness.
LID - ajnr.A8901 [pii]
LID - 10.3174/ajnr.A8901 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Chronic Multisymptom Illness includes symptoms of 
      fatigue, pain, sleep difficulties, as well as neurological, respiratory, and 
      gastrointestinal problems and is particularly common in veterans from the 1990-91 
      Gulf War and the Afghanistan and Iraq Wars. Glymphatic system function may play 
      an important role in the etiopathology of Chronic Multisymptom Illness but has 
      not been addressed. DTI-derived analysis along the perivascular space provides a 
      promising proxy for glymphatic system function by evaluating the status of 
      perivascular space fluid flow. The objective of this study was to compare this 
      DTI-derived glymphatic index in veterans with CMI and healthy controls, and to 
      reveal possible correlations between this index and the severity of CMI symptoms. 
      MATERIALS AND METHODS: DTI-derived indices were extracted from imaging data of 
      203 veterans who met clinical diagnostic criteria for Chronic Multisymptom 
      Illness, and 224 age-matched healthy control subjects from multiple public 
      research databases. Severity of Chronic Multisymptom Illness, sleep difficulty, 
      pain intensity, and the degree of chronic fatigue were based on self-report 
      measures. MRI scanner and site variations were harmonized. Statistical analyses 
      were performed adjusting for demographic confounding factors. RESULTS: Both 
      healthy controls and veterans showed significantly reduced glymphatic indices 
      associated with increased age. Compared to controls, veterans showed bilaterally 
      lower indices (Cohen's d = -.47; p < .001) after adjusting for age, sex, and 
      education. Across the entire sample of veterans, negative correlations were 
      observed between glymphatic indices and pain intensities (r = -.17; p = .01), 
      sleep disturbances (r = -.17; p = .02), degree of fatigue (r = -.20; p = .006), 
      severity of Chronic Multisymptom Illness (r = -.17; p = .02), and the indices 
      were positively correlated with medullar volumes (r = -.19; p = .007). Note, 
      these results showing significant outcomes for a group of patients do not 
      guarantee the same outcome for individual patients. CONCLUSIONS: This study 
      suggests that impaired glymphatic functions are strongly associated with Chronic 
      Multisymptom Illness. These findings improve our understanding of the 
      pathological mechanism underlying Chronic Multisymptom Illness and point to 
      DTI-based metrics as a potential biomarker for disease severity in this 
      condition. ABBREVIATIONS: CMI＝ Chronic multisymptom illness; GWI＝ Gulf War

TI  - Molecular Hydrogen as an Adjuvant Therapy in Comorbid Sjogren's Syndrome, SLE, 
      and ILD: A Case Report on Immune Modulation and Fatigue Reduction.
PG  - 2228-2235
LID - 10.21873/invivo.14018 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND/AIM: Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and Sjogren's syndrome (SS) 
      are chronic autoimmune diseases that often coexist. They share features such as 
      systemic inflammation and multi-organ involvement and typically require long-term 
      immunosuppressive treatment. However, long-term use of immunosuppressants can 
      cause serious side effects, highlighting the need for adjunct therapies. 
      Molecular hydrogen (H(2)) therapy shows anti-inflammatory, antioxidant, and 
      immunomodulatory properties, with potential benefits in liver, lung, and 
      metabolic diseases. This case report examines a patient with overlapping SLE, SS, 
      and interstitial lung disease (ILD), evaluating the effects of molecular hydrogen 
      therapy on fatigue, immune modulation, and cardiac function. CASE REPORT: We 
      present the case of a 69-year-old female diagnosed with Sjogren's syndrome, SLE, 
      and ILD. The patient exhibited chronic symptoms, including xerostomia, 
      xerophthalmia, and respiratory distress, for which she had been receiving 
      corticosteroids and immunomodulatory therapy. Given the persistent disease burden 
      and concerns regarding long-term immunosuppressive therapy, molecular hydrogen 
      therapy was introduced as an adjunctive treatment. Over several months, the 
      patient experienced notable clinical improvements, including resolution of 
      xerostomia, insomnia, dyspnea, chest pain, and dizziness. These symptomatic 
      improvements correlated with favorable immunological shifts in T and B cell 
      subsets, enhanced pulmonary imaging findings, and a reduction in inflammatory 
      markers. Additionally, the patient reported a significant decrease in fatigue, 
      allowing corticosteroid tapering and less reliance on nighttime oxygen. Ongoing 
      hydrogen therapy with high-dose vitamin C maintained disease stability and 
      improved quality of life. CONCLUSION: This case highlights the potential of 
      molecular hydrogen (H(2)) therapy as a safe, effective adjunct in managing 
      overlapping Sjogren's syndrome, SLE, and ILD. H(2) therapy improved immune 
      profiles and stabilized symptoms in a patient unresponsive to standard 
      treatments.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: Cognitive frailty (CF) is a clinical syndrome characterised by the 
      concurrent occurrence of physical frailty and cognitive impairment, excluding 
      Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia. Recent studies have shown that 
      combining aerobic exercise (AE) and meditation (ME) effectively enhances both 
      physical and cognitive functions in individuals with CF. The study aims to 
      determine whether the combined application of AE and ME can elicit significantly 
      greater improvements in physical and cognitive functions among individuals with 
      CF compared with the independent practice of either AE or ME alone. METHODS AND 
      ANALYSIS: The research design employs a four-arm, assessor-blind randomised 
      controlled trial. A total of 140 qualified subjects will be randomly allocated 
      among four groups: AE, ME, AE combined with ME and a health education control 
      group, ensuring equivalent distribution across groups. The intervention phase of 
      the study will last for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes will include the Edmonton 
      Frailty Scale, while secondary outcomes will encompass evaluations of cognitive 
      functions (including global cognitive function, memory, attention, executive 
      function and visuospatial abilities), physical performance (measured by gait 
      speed and lower extremity strength), subjective experiences (such as fatigue, 
      quality of life, mindfulness, mood and sleep quality), as well as structural and 
      functional MRI assessments and serum biomarkers. Outcomes will be evaluated at 
      baseline and following the 12-week intervention. ETHICS AND DISSEMINATION: The 
      Ethics Committee of the Affiliated Rehabilitation Hospital of the Fujian 
      University of Traditional Chinese Medicine granted ethical approval for the study 
      (2023KY-012-02). The findings will be disseminated through publications in 
      peer-reviewed journals and presentations at academic conferences. TRIAL

AB  - OBJECTIVE: To develop and validate a clinically practical nomogram for predicting 
      depression risk in older adults with cognitive impairment. METHODS: 
      Cross-sectional data from the 2018 Chinese Longitudinal Healthy Longevity Survey 
      (CLHLS) included 3254 adults >/=65 years. Cognitive impairment was defined by 
      Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) scores </=24; depression by Center for 
      Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CESD) >/=10. Participants were divided into 
      training (n = 2278) and test (n = 976) sets. Variables included demographics, 
      lifestyle, and medical history. LASSO regression (10-fold cross-validation) 
      identified key predictors; multivariate logistic regression constructed the 
      nomogram. Model performance was evaluated using area under the curve (AUC), 
      calibration curves, and internal/external validation. RESULTS: Eight independent 
      predictors were identified: younger age (OR = 0.981), living alone (OR = 1.584), 
      smoking history (OR = 0.650), poor sleep quality (e.g., ""very poor"" OR = 50.326), 
      infrequent outdoor activities (OR = 2.272), rare reading (OR = 5.558), limited 
      TV/radio exposure (OR = 1.905), and cataract history (OR = 1.587). The nomogram 
      demonstrated strong discrimination (AUC training: 0.807; test: 0.716) and good 
      calibration (Hosmer-Lemeshow P = 0.491, internal validation; bootstrap 
      MAE = 0.011 confirming stability). CONCLUSION: This nomogram integrates 
      modifiable lifestyle and clinical factors for depression risk stratification in 
      cognitively impaired older adults. Its simplicity and accuracy suit 
      resource-limited settings, enabling early intervention and personalized care. 
      Limitations include the cross-sectional design, reliance on a single data source 
      which may affect external validity beyond the tested sample, the assumption of 
      linearity for some lifestyle factors, and the absence of a control group of 
      depressed individuals without cognitive impairment for comparative analysis.

AB  - A cross-sectional study was designed to investigate the relationship between 
      immune parameters and sleep quality in patients with depression, in which 65 
      depression patients and 63 healthy controls were enrolled between August 2021 and 
      June 2024, with sleep assessments ultimately completed by 59 depression patients 
      following exclusions. Th17/Treg cell ratios and cytokine levels were measured 
      using flow cytometry and cytometric bead array (CBA), and correlation and 
      regression analyses were performed to evaluate associations between sleep quality 
      and inflammatory markers. Elevated Th17 cells, Th17/Treg imbalance, and increased 
      IL-6 and IL-17 levels were observed in depression patients compared to controls 
      (all P < 0.0167), while higher IL-4, IL-6, and IL-17 levels were found in 
      patients with sleep disorders (all P < 0.0071). Th17/Treg ratios were positively 
      correlated with sleep disturbance scores, whereas Treg levels showed an inverse 
      correlation, and IL-6, IL-17, IFN-gamma, and TNF-alpha levels were positively associated 
      with sleep disturbances (all P < 0.05). Furthermore, IL-6 and IFN-gamma were 
      identified as significant predictors of poor sleep quality (all P < 0.05). These 
      findings suggest that inflammatory dysregulation, particularly elevated IL-6 and 
      IFN-gamma, is associated with poorer sleep quality in depression patients, providing 
      potential insights for enhanced clinical management.

AB  - Salvianolic acid A (SAL A), a polyphenolic compound derived from Salvia 
      miltiorrhiza, exhibits several neuroprotective effects, but its sedative 
      potential is unexamined. This study explores the sedative effects of SAL A and 
      its potential to modulate the impacts of diazepam (DZP) in a thiopental sodium 
      (TS)-induced sleep model in Swiss albino mice. Mice received intraperitoneal 
      (i.p.) doses of SAL A (5 and 10 mg/kg) and DZP (2 mg/kg), followed by TS 
      (20 mg/kg), with sleep latency and duration recorded. Molecular docking and in 
      silico analyses evaluated SAL A's interaction with the GABA(A) receptor (alpha1 and 
      beta2 subunits) (PDB ID: 6X3X) and its pharmacokinetic properties. Results revealed 
      that SAL A significantly (p < 0.05) reduced sleep latency and prolonged sleep 
      duration dose-dependently, with 10 mg/kg showing the strongest effect (latency: 
      14.29 +/- 3.09 min; duration: 175.71 +/- 18.97 min; Cohen's d = 4.37 and 1.60, 
      respectively). Combined therapy with SAL A-10 and DZP-2 synergistically enhanced 
      sleep duration, with the highest effect sizes observed (d = 5.45 for latency; 
      4.36 for duration). Molecular docking studies revealed that SAL A showed similar 
      binding affinity (-8.7 kcal/mol) with 6X3X, comparable to DZP. SAL A also 
      exhibited favorable pharmacokinetic properties and low toxicity. These findings 
      suggest SAL A as a potential novel sedative agent with synergistic effects 
      alongside DZP. However, SAL A's poor blood-brain barrier permeability and need 
      for structural optimization highlight the necessity for future mechanistic 
      studies, enhanced delivery methods, and clinical validation to confirm its 
      therapeutic potential for sleep disorders.

AB  - OBJECTIVES: This study examined the associations between retirement, 
      reemployment, and health outcomes-covering physical, mental, and social 
      domains-among middle-aged and older adults in Taiwan. STUDY DESIGN: Data were 
      drawn from the Healthy Aging Longitudinal Study in Taiwan (HALST), with 4015 
      participants (mean age 68.2 +/- 7.7) and two waves of follow-up. We applied 
      difference-in-differences analyses to evaluate the effects of retirement and 
      reemployment on health outcomes. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Quality of life was 
      assessed using the 12-item Short Form (SF-12) survey. Physical health was 
      assessed using the Short Physical Performance Battery (SPPB) and Fried's frailty 
      criteria. Mental health was measured via the Mini-Mental State Examination 
      (MMSE), CES-D scale, and self-reported insomnia. Social networks were also 
      evaluated. RESULTS: Newly retired individuals, especially men and those under 65, 
      experienced declines in physical health, including lower SF-12 physical scores 
      (-1.62), poorer SPPB performance (-0.52), and greater risk of frailty (1.66). In 
      contrast, reemployment, particularly full-time, was linked to better physical 
      health (SF-12 1.78; SPPB 0.39), with stronger effects among women and older 
      adults. Part-time reemployment was associated with enhanced social networks, 
      though physical gains were limited. No consistent mental health effects were 
      observed, except for higher depressive symptoms in those retiring for 
      non-voluntary reasons. CONCLUSIONS: Retirement was linked to physical health 
      decline, while reemployment, especially full-time, offered protective effects. 
      Policies should be tailored to the diverse needs of retirees, accounting for age, 
      gender, and reasons for retirement, to support healthier aging across 
      populations.

      Officers' Training Corps Cadets.

LID - 10.1093/milmed/usaf307 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: The U.S. Army developed the Holistic Health and Fitness system and 
      Army Combat Fitness Test (ACFT) to support the overall readiness of soldiers from 
      a framework that assesses multiple domains of health. Although modifiable healthy 
      lifestyle behaviors (MHLB)-diet, sleep, and physical activity (PA)-are presumed 
      to influence ACFT performance, research on this relationship, particularly among 
      Reserve Officers' Training Corps (ROTC) cadets, is limited. This study examines 
      the relationship between MHLB and ACFT performance to understand their impact on 
      fitness outcomes. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 83 
      Army ROTC cadets from a single university. Participants completed 3 electronic 
      surveys assessing dietary behaviors, sleep quality, and PA, and performed the 
      ACFT. Anthropometric data, including height, mass, and body composition, were 
      also collected. Nonparametric statistical tests were conducted to assess 
      relationships between MHLB and ACFT performance. RESULTS: Descriptive statistics 
      revealed that 55.4% of cadets had poor sleep quality, and 9.6% exhibited poor 
      dietary habits. All but 2 cadets passed the ACFT. No significant correlations 
      were found between MHLB and ACFT scores, either across the entire sample or 
      within gender and military science class subgroups. CONCLUSIONS: The absence of 
      significant correlations between MHLB and ACFT performance challenges common 
      assumptions and highlights the complexity of optimizing readiness in military 
      populations. Although most cadets reported adequate PA levels and acceptable diet 
      quality, the prevalence of poor sleep quality highlights an area for targeted 
      intervention. These results demonstrate the value of holistic health assessments 
      to support the overall well-being and readiness of ROTC populations.

TI  - A randomized controlled trial comparing sleep hygiene advice with a self-help 
      book focusing on cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia: a study among 
      patients with prescribed hypnotics from the GP.
PG  - 1-10
LID - 10.1080/02813432.2025.2525423 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Chronic insomnia is commonly treated with hypnotics. However, the 
      treatment of choice is cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia (CBTi). We 
      investigated whether a self-help book based on CBTi is effective in reducing 
      hypnotic use and improving sleep. METHODS: Patients who had received a 
      prescription from their GP for z-hypnotics (zopiclone or zolpidem) in the last 
      6 months were recruited through PraksisNett, an infrastructure within General 
      Practice, for a randomized controlled trial comparing written materials in form 
      of a sheet of sleep hygiene advice and a self-help book. The participants 
      completed an online questionnaire about hypnotic use, insomnia symptoms, sleep 
      duration, anxiety and depression before the intervention and at 4-5 months 
      follow-up. RESULTS: In total, 125 patients (response rate 72.7%) completed the 
      follow-up questionnaire. Interaction analyses indicated effects favoring the 
      self-help book for hypnotic use and anxiety. The book reduced the proportion 
      using hypnotics daily from 25.4% to 18.6%, while the proportion increased from 
      21.2% to 22.7% in the sleep hygiene group. The proportion reporting anxiety was 
      reduced from 32.1% to 23.2% in the self-help book group, while it increased from 
      27.0% to 31.7% in the sleep hygiene group. Insomnia symptoms were lowered in both 
      intervention groups, whereas depression remained unchanged. CONCLUSION: This 
      study indicated that the self-help book was an effective low-threshold treatment 
      option that seems to reduce hypnotic use and at the same time improve sleep and 
      mental health. The patients who received sleep hygiene advice also reported some 
      positive effects, but daily hypnotic use and anxiety increased.

AB  - THE PURPOSE OF THE STUDY: To assess objective and subjective sleep indicators in 
      patients with chronic tension headache and their change during therapy. MATERIAL 
      AND METHODS: The study included 65 patients with chronic tension headache and 
      insomnia. The assessment was conducted using headache questionnaires (headache 
      VAS, headache diary, HIT-6, pain catastrophization scale), sleep quality 
      questionnaires (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), sleep quality VAS), 
      psychometric testing (Beck Depression Scale, Sheehan Anxiety Scale), a central 
      sensitization questionnaire, and polysomnography. Patients were divided into two 
      groups: patients of group 1 received prophylactic treatment with a drug for 
      relief of insomnia symptoms and recommendations for sleep hygiene according to 
      clinical guidelines, and patients of group 2 received only a drug for 
      prophylactic treatment of headache. RESULTS: In the group with insomnia 
      treatment, the duration of the S3 phase of slow-wave sleep increased from 31.5 
      (27;36) to 47 (42;49) minutes and the subjective duration of sleep from 360+/-90 to 
      453.33+/-66.14 minutes, the severity of insomnia PSQI score decreased from 13 
      (10;15) to 7 (5;10) points, the frequency of headache reduced from 20.00 [17.00; 
      24.00] to 8.00 [5.00; 11.00] days and the pain intensity VAS decreased from 7.00 
      [6.00; 7.00] to 4.00 [3.00; 6.00] points, the anxiety severity according to the 
      Sheehan Anxiety Scale decreased from 43 [26;51] to 19 [16;34 ] points and 
      depression severity according to the Beck Depression Scale reduced from 14 
      [12;18] to 7 [6;10.5] points. CONCLUSION: Diagnosis and treatment of insomnia in 
      patients with chronic tension headaches is an important strategy in managing this 
      group of patients. This strategy allows not only to improve the objective and 
      subjective sleep parameters but also to reduce the headache and the severity of 
      comorbidities.

AB  - Insomnia is a highly prevalent condition in the general population that has 
      multiple social and health consequences. Insomnia can be both a separate clinical 
      syndrome and a symptom of many mental disorders, thereby increasing the severity 
      of the underlying disease and the risk of relapse. Some medications can also 
      cause insomnia. Timely treatment of insomnia can lead to a favorable outcome 
      (recovery) not only by alleviating the symptoms of a concomitant mental disorder, 
      but also by preventing new episodes. Therefore, it is crucial to be aware of the 
      association between insomnia and mental illness. This review addresses this 
      association and provides guidelines for diagnosis and therapy.

AB  - INTRODUCTION: This letter critically evaluates the methodology of Eva Hjort 
      Telhede's qualitative study exploring insomnia experiences among nursing homes. 
      While the study contributes valuable insights into subjective sleep challenges, 
      its methodological rigour warrants scrutiny to inform future research. METHODS: 
      The study employed a qualitative descriptive design with semi-structured 
      interviews (n = 19 participants) and inductive content analysis. Data collection 
      occurred in nine Swedish nursing homes, with purposive sampling based on insomnia 
      criteria (ICD-10) and cognitive competence (S-MMSE >/=20). Analysis followed 
      Graneheim and Lundman's qualitative content analysis framework. RESULTS: Key 
      methodological strengths included purposive sampling, data saturation, and 
      reflexive practices. Limitations identified were single-researcher bias, lack of 
      intercoder reliability checks, gender imbalance (4 men, 15 women), and exclusion 
      of variables such as cognitive diagnoses and medication use. Environmental 
      factors (e.g. noise and lighting) were self-reported without objective 
      validation, and contextual transferability was constrained by limited demographic 
      diversity. DISCUSSION: The reliance on a single coder and absence of 
      triangulation may compromise the depth of thematic analysis. Recommendations 
      include: (1) multi-researcher collaboration to enhance credibility; (2) inclusive 
      sampling of residents with dementia; (3) mixed-methods designs integrating 
      objective sleep measures; and (4) staff training in sleep hygiene to address 
      institutional barriers. Strengthening methodological transparency and addressing 
      contextual factors could improve future interventions for insomnia in nursing 
      homes.

TI  - Vagal nerve stimulation and fibromyalgia: an additional therapeutic option.
PG  - 1095-1104
LID - 10.55563/clinexprheumatol/johqvo [doi]
AB  - OBJECTIVES: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic syndrome characterised by widespread 
      pain, sleep, mood and cognitive disturbances, asthenia and muscle stiffness. The 
      aetiopathogenesis of FM is not fully understood, but autonomic nervous system 
      dysfunction could play a fundamental role in the development of chronic pain and 
      could alter serum levels of neuro-inflammatory mediators like Brain Derived 
      Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF). Transcutaneous vagus nerve stimulation (tVNS) is a 
      non-invasive bioelectronic technique that increases parasympathetic nervous 
      system activity and there is growing evidence that it can modulate nociception 
      and improve mood and sleep quality. The aim of this pilot study was to evaluate 
      the efficacy of auricular vagal neuromodulation therapy (AVNT) in reducing 
      disease severity and improving sleep quality of FM patients; secondly, to 
      evaluate fluctuations in serum BDNF levels after treatment. METHODS: Eighteen 
      patients with FM, underwent AVNT treatment consisting of 30-minute stimulation, 
      5 times a week, for 4 consecutive weeks. RESULTS: After two weeks of treatment, 
      an early reduction in the WPI score (p=0.03) was detected, then confirmed at week 
      4 (p=0.004). At week 4, significant reduction either in the revised Fibromyalgia 
      Impact Questionnaire (rFIQ) total score (p=0.02), rFIQ general health (p=0.002) 
      and symptoms (p<0.001) components and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) 
      level (p=0.02) was also detected. No significant changes in BDNF levels were 
      found either after two or four weeks of treatment. CONCLUSIONS: In conclusion, 
      our preliminary results show that the treatment with AVNT reduced disease 
      severity and improved sleep quality in FM patients.

TI  - Association of substance use with stress-related sleep disturbance among 
      adolescents in 76 countries: a global population-based study.
PG  - 04195
LID - 10.7189/jogh.15.04195 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Stress-related sleep disturbance has emerged as a significant public 
      health concern among adolescents worldwide. The independent and combined effects 
      of substance use on stress-related sleep disturbance remain inconclusive. We 
      aimed to explore the association of the use of substances such as tobacco and 
      alcohol with stress-related sleep disturbance among adolescents in 76 countries. 
      METHODS: We collected data from the global school-based student health survey, 
      which comprised 302 181 adolescents aged 12-17 years from 76 countries. The 
      frequency of tobacco and alcohol use in the past 30 days was categorised as 
      follows: zero, one to two, three to nine, 10-29, and 30 days. Tobacco and alcohol 
      use were classified into four categories: non-use, tobacco use alone, alcohol use 
      alone, and combined use. We used multivariate logistic regression analyses to 
      examine the independent and combined associations of tobacco and alcohol use with 
      stress-related sleep disturbance. RESULTS: As the frequency of tobacco use and 
      alcohol use increases, the proportion of stress-related sleep disturbance among 
      adolescents shows an upward trend (for tobacco use 8.3-27.4%, for alcohol use 
      6.7-28.9%). Compared to non-drinkers, the odds of having stress-related sleep 
      disturbance increased with frequency of drinking from one to two days to 30 days 
      (from odds ratio (OR) = 1.53; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.31-1.78 to 
      OR = 3.13; 95% CI = 1.99-4.90), as well as with the frequency of tobacco use 
      (from OR = 1.11; 95% CI = 0.88-1.39 to OR = 1.98; 95% CI = 1.39-2.81) during the 
      past 30 days. CONCLUSIONS: We found both tobacco and alcohol use, as well as 
      their combination, were associated with stress-related sleep disturbance. These 
      findings emphasise the need to strengthen the prevention and control of tobacco 
      and alcohol use among adolescents in order to reduce stress-related sleep 
      disturbance and improve sleep quality.

TI  - Sleep quality in perimenopausal and postmenopausal women: which exercise therapy 
      is the most effective? A systematic review and network meta-analysis of 31 RCTs.

AB  - The effectiveness of various exercise types in improving sleep quality in 
      menopausal women remains controversial. This network meta-analysis was designed 
      to evaluate and rank the efficacy of five exercise modalities on sleep quality in 
      peri-postmenopausal women. Five English databases and three Chinese databases 
      were searched for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published from inception to 
      July 2024. Pairwise meta-analysis and frequentist network meta-analyses were 
      performed based on the random effects model. The analysis revealed that younger 
      menopausal women (age </=55 years) (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -2.00; 95% 
      confidence interval [CI] [-2.70, -1.31]), those with sleep disorders (SMD = 
      -2.29; 95% CI [-2.79, -1.78]) and those from Asia (SMD = -2.50, 95% CI [-3.62, 
      -1.38]) were able to derive greater health benefits. Flexibility exercise (low 
      certainty) and aerobic exercise (low certainty), combined exercise (moderate 
      certainty) and mind-body exercise (moderate certainty) significantly improved 
      sleep quality. Combined exercise showed the highest efficacy (surface under the 
      cumulative ranking curve [SUCRA] = 93.5%), followed by flexibility exercise 
      (SUCRA = 76%), and these exercises also showed a positive effect on women's 
      quality of life (SMD = 0.49; 95% CI [0.13, 0.84]; p = 0.007). Future research 
      should develop more acceptable exercise intervention models and use combined and 
      flexibility exercises to explore the optimal parameters of exercise for 
      menopausal women.

TI  - Insomnia, Pain, and Pain-Related Dysfunctional Beliefs About Sleep among Patients 
      with Cancer.
LID - 10.4143/crt.2025.372 [doi]
AB  - PURPOSE: We explored the reliability and validity of the Pain-related Beliefs and 
      Attitudes about Sleep (PBAS) scale among patients with cancer. Further, we 
      compared the usability of the PBAS scale with that of the Cancer-related 
      Dysfunctional Beliefs and Attitudes about Sleep-14 (C-DBAS-14) among patients 
      with cancer. MATERIALS AND METHODS: The medical records of 252 patients with 
      cancer who visited the Sleep Clinic from August 1, 2023 to June 30, 2024 were 
      retrospectively analyzed. The responses of the enrolled patients to the PBAS, 
      C-DBAS-14, Insomnia Severity Index (ISI), and Numeric Rating Scale of pain were 
      collected. RESULTS: The internal consistency reliability of the PBAS scale was 
      excellent (Cronbach's alpha of 0.96). Confirmatory factor analysis showed that 
      the two-factor structure of the PBAS for patients with cancer is a good fit for 
      the model (CFI=0.99, TLI=0.99, RMSEA=0.14, SRMR=0.05). The convergent validity of 
      the Korean version of the PBAS in patients with cancer was good, as indicated by 
      its significant association with pain severity (r=0.63, p<0.001), C-DBAS-14 
      (r=0.33, p<0.001), and ISI (r=0.21, p<0.01). The PBAS adequately reflected an 
      increase in pain severity and was more effective and appropriate for capturing 
      pain-related dysfunctional sleep beliefs than the C-DBAS-14. CONCLUSION: The 
      Korean version of the PBAS showed high reliability and validity in patients with 
      cancer, and applicability across cancer types and cancer-related beliefs.

TI  - The sleep quality and its association with disease activity in patients with 
      inflammatory bowel disease: a meta-analysis.
LID - 10.17235/reed.2025.11305/2025 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), including ulcerative colitis (UC) 
      and Crohn's disease (CD), is linked to poor sleep quality, though evidence 
      remains inconsistent. This meta-analysis aimed to evaluate sleep quality in IBD 
      patients and its association with disease activity. METHODS: We systematically 
      searched databases up to February 2025 for studies reporting sleep quality in 
      IBD. Outcomes included pooled prevalence of poor sleep, odds ratios (ORs), and 
      standardized mean differences (SMDs) comparing IBD patients to controls, UC vs 
      CD, and active vs inactive disease. Heterogeneity was assessed using Cochran's Q 
      and I(2) statistics. RESULTS: Fifty-five studies were included. Poor sleep 
      prevalence was 60% in IBD, 52% in UC, 56% in CD, and 68% in active IBD. IBD 
      patients had higher odds of poor sleep than controls (OR: 1.90, 95% CI: 
      1.38-2.61; SMD: 0.61, 95% CI: 0.32-0.89). No differences emerged between UC and 
      CD (OR: 0.93; SMD: -0.04). Active IBD patients showed elevated poor sleep risk 
      versus those in remission (OR: 2.09, 95% CI: 1.50-2.90), driven by CD (OR: 2.40, 
      95% CI: 1.42-4.05). SMDs for active vs inactive disease were 0.49 (IBD overall), 
      0.40 (UC), and 0.73 (CD). CONCLUSION: Poor sleep is highly prevalent in IBD, 
      particularly during active disease, with significantly higher rates than in 
      healthy controls. Sleep quality did not differ between UC and CD. Addressing poor 
      sleep in IBD management and exploring underlying mechanisms are crucial for 
      improving patient outcomes.

TI  - Effects of sleep quality and fatigue on nursing performance in intensive care 
      settings.
LID - 10.7748/nm.2025.e2162 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Nursing is a profession that requires high levels of attention, sound 
      judgment and quick responses, particularly in emergency settings. Fatigue causes 
      reduced attention, lower physical capacity, irritability, forgetfulness and 
      communication difficulties and therefore negatively affects nursing performance. 
      AIM: To investigate how sleep quality and fatigue affect the performance of 
      nurses working in intensive care units (ICUs) and critical cardiac units (CCUs) 
      at government hospitals in the West Bank, Palestine. METHOD: A descriptive 
      cross-sectional survey study design was used. A total of 121 nurses employed in 
      four hospitals in the West Bank responded to a self-administered questionnaire, 
      which involved completing the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI), Fatigue 
      Severity Scale (FSS) and Nursing Performance Instrument (NPI). RESULTS: The 
      results showed that 79% of participants had poor sleep quality and 50% of 
      participants experienced fatigue. Poor sleep quality and fatigue negatively 
      affected nursing performance. Fatigue affected mental performance more than 
      physical performance. CONCLUSION: Given the risks involved for nurses and 
      patients when nurses working in intensive care settings experience poor sleep 
      quality and fatigue, healthcare organisations need to take measures to address 
      these issues.

      randomized pilot trial.
PG  - zpaf037

LID - zpaf037
AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Two in five Veterans report symptoms of insomnia, with higher 
      rates among those who drink heavily. Although Cognitive Behavioral Therapy for 
      Insomnia (CBT-I) has demonstrated efficacy among those with Alcohol Use Disorder, 
      abstinence is often considered a prerequisite for treatment, leaving its impact 
      unclear among those who are actively drinking. This trial tested the efficacy of 
      CBT-I among heavy-drinking Veterans with insomnia (#NCT03804788). METHODS: 
      Veterans from across the United States were randomly assigned to CBT-I or sleep 
      hygiene control. Participants completed retrospective surveys and 14 sleep 
      diaries at baseline, post-treatment, and 3-month follow-up. Primary outcomes were 
      feasibility and insomnia severity. All other outcomes are secondary/exploratory. 
      Intent-to-treat analyses were conducted using multilevel models. RESULTS: 
      Recruitment spanned June 2019 to March 2023 (N = 71, 80% male, M = 38 years). On 
      average, we recruited 4 participants per month, with retention of 86% at 
      post-treatment and 90% at follow-up. Of 38 CBT-I participants, 33 (87%) completed 
      all 5 treatment sessions, and most responded to treatment (based on change in 
      outcome scores; 22/38 at post, 27/38 at follow-up). Relative to control (n = 33), 
      CBT-I participants reported large improvements in insomnia severity, both 
      post-treatment [d = 1.26 (95% CI: 0.74, 1.76)] and at 3-month follow-up [d = 1.33 
      (95% CI: 0.81, 1.84)]. At follow-up, results for use of alcohol as a sleep aid 
      [d = 0.66 (95% CI: 0.18, 1.14)] and sleep medication [d = 0.44 (95% CI: -0.03, 
      0.91)] also favored CBT-I. CONCLUSIONS: CBT-I is feasible among heavy-drinking 
      Veterans and has large effects on insomnia severity. Studies testing mechanistic 
      effects on alcohol outcomes are warranted. CLINICAL TRIAL INFORMATION: The iTAP 
      Study for Veterans, registered on clinicaltrials.gov (#NCT03804788) on January 
      11, 2019: https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03804788?term=NCT03804788&rank=1.

      multivariable-adjusted and Mendelian randomization analyses in UK Biobank.
PG  - ziaf085
LID - 10.1093/jbmrpl/ziaf085 [doi]
LID - ziaf085
AB  - Experimental studies suggest an association between sleep disturbances and 
      osteoporosis risk, but epidemiological data remain inconclusive. This study 
      investigated associations and possible causality between 4 sleep traits and 
      osteoporosis risk, as well as BMD, in a large population-based cohort. We 
      analyzed 402 533 UK Biobank participants with no history of osteoporosis at 
      baseline (44.8% men, mean age 56.6 yr [SD 8.1], median follow-up 13.1 [IQR 
      12.8-14.4] yr). Multivariable-adjusted regression analyses assessed the 
      associations between self-reported sleep traits at baseline and osteoporosis 
      incidence, and BMD T-scores at the femoral neck, lumbar spine and radius. 
      Two-sample Mendelian randomization (MR) was employed to provide evidence of 
      potential causality. Self-reported short (<7 h) and long (>8 h) sleep durations, 
      insomnia symptoms, daytime dozing, and evening chronotype were all associated 
      with increased osteoporosis incidence. Conversely, no associations were observed 
      between sleep traits and T-scores, except that an evening chronotype was 
      associated with lower femoral neck T-score. Having a greater number of poor sleep 
      behaviors was associated with increased osteoporosis risk and lower T-scores. MR 
      did not support a causal relationship between sleep traits and osteoporosis risk 
      or BMD. Since all sleep behaviors are associated with osteoporosis risk, 
      assessing sleep patterns could be valuable to identify individuals-at-risk. 
      However, the absence of causal evidence and limited associations with BMD suggest 
      that sleep disturbances do not influence bone remodeling directly. Instead, the 
      interaction between sleep and osteoporosis may involve unidentified mechanisms 
      requiring further investigation.

AB  - BACKGROUND: The aim of the study was to evaluate preoperative anxiety, 
      postoperative pain and functional impairment using Brief Pain Inventory (BPI) in 
      patients undergoing surgery for malignancy. METHODS: Between September 2020 and 
      May 2022, a total of 94 patients (60 males, 34 females; mean age 59.5+/-12.2 years; 
      range, 32 to 84 years) who underwent surgery for lung cancer were prospectively 
      analyzed. The patients were evaluated using the BPI preoperatively and on 
      postoperative Days 0, 3, and 30. The preoperative emotional impacts of patient 
      variables and the influence of surgical management on postoperative pain were 
      examined. RESULTS: Females experienced more preoperative emotional distress and 
      insomnia (p=0.046, p=0.033, respectively). Patients diagnosed with cancer and had 
      a history of surgery or thoracotomy demonstrated higher preoperative emotional 
      distress (p=0.001, p<0.001, p<0.001, respectively). Postoperatively, patients who 
      underwent thoracotomy reported greater pain with higher functional impairment 
      compared to the video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery group (p=0.002, p=0.018, 
      respectively). Patients whose drains were completely removed by the postoperative 
      Day 3 had reduced discomfort and improved ability to perform breathing exercise 
      (p=0.005, p=0.045, respectively). Thoracotomy and the placement of double drains 
      were identified as independent factors contributing to difficulties in performing 
      breathing exercises and coughing on Day 30 (p<0.05 for all). There was no 
      significant difference in the pain scores and affected functions between the 
      patients with a thoracotomy incision size of <10 cm and >/=10 cm (p=0.200, p=0.113, 
      respectively). CONCLUSION: Our study results indicate that a preference for 
      minimal invasive procedures, the use of a single thoracic drain, and the prompt 
      removal of the drain minimize pain and functional impairment. Women, patients 
      with a preoperative diagnosis of malignancy requiring metastasectomy, and history 
      of thoracotomy or surgery experience elevated levels of anxiety. Therefore, 
      consistent monitoring and psychological support may be recommended to improve the 
      quality of life for this patient population.

AB  - Sleep disorders, particularly insomnia, have emerged as a critical public health 
      challenge, with the situation worsened by the coronavirus disease-2019 pandemic. 
      Insomnia symptoms, which affected up to 45% of the population during this period, 
      highlight the urgent need to understand the mechanisms linking sleep disturbances 
      to mental health outcomes. Recent findings suggest that cognitive failures, such 
      as memory lapses and attentional deficits, mediate the relationship between 
      insomnia and emotional disorders such as anxiety and depression. The role of 
      personality traits, particularly neuroticism, adds further complexity, as it may 
      either exacerbate or buffer these effects under specific conditions. This review 
      explores the study by Li et al, which offers valuable insights into the 
      cognitive-emotional pathways influenced by sleep disturbances. The study makes 
      significant contributions by identifying key cognitive mechanisms and proposing 
      the dual role of neuroticism in shaping emotional outcomes. To advance these 
      findings, this letter advocates for future longitudinal research and the 
      integration of targeted interventions, such as cognitive-behavioral therapy for 
      insomnia, into public health frameworks. By addressing insomnia-induced cognitive 
      dysfunction, these strategies can enhance emotional regulation and foster 
      resilience, particularly in vulnerable populations facing the mental health 
      impacts of the pandemic.

AB  - BACKGROUND: As the aging process has accelerated, psychological problems in older 
      patients with chronic heart failure (CHF) have become increasingly prominent, 
      significantly affecting their quality of life and prognosis. This study explored 
      a sports rehabilitation program based on the concept of medical care-family 
      integration to provide patients with comprehensive and effective rehabilitation 
      interventions and improve their health status. AIM: To explore the effects of 
      medical care-family integration-based exercise rehabilitation in older patients 
      with CHF and psychological problems. METHODS: Data from 118 older patients with 
      CHF and psychological problems were retrospectively analyzed. Patients were 
      divided into conventional (n = 56) and exercise rehabilitation groups (n = 62). 
      The results of the 6-min walking distance (6 MWD), N-terminal B-type natriuretic 
      peptide (NT-proBNP), left ventricular end-diastolic diameter (LVEDD), left 
      ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), Minnesota living with heart failure 
      questionnaire (MLHFQ), generalized anxiety disorder-7 (GAD-7) scale, 9-item 
      patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9) and Athens insomnia scale (AIS) were 
      compared before and after intervention. RESULTS: After intervention, there were 
      significant differences in the number of patients with depression and anxiety 
      between the two groups. There was also a significant difference in the 
      distribution of sleep disorders. The PHQ-9 score, GAD-7 score, AIS score, 
      NT-proBNP value, LVEDD value, physical field, emotional field, other fields, and 
      MLHFQ total scores were lower in the exercise rehabilitation group compared to 
      the conventional rehabilitation group, while the 6 MWD and LVEF values were 
      higher compared to the conventional rehabilitation group (P < 0.05). During the 
      intervention period, the readmission rate of the exercise rehabilitation group 
      (1.61%) was significantly lower than that of the conventional rehabilitation 
      group (12.50%) (chi (2) = 3.930, P = 0.047). CONCLUSION: This exercise 
      rehabilitation program with medical care-family integration can improve cardiac 
      function and quality of life, alleviate psychological problems, and reduce 
      readmission rates in older patients with CHF.

AB  - Insomnia, anxiety, and depression have become critical mental health issues 
      exacerbated by the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic, highlighting the importance 
      of understanding their interrelationships. This article evaluates the study by Li 
      et al, which investigates the links between insomnia, anxiety, and depression 
      while examining the mediating role of cognitive failures and the moderating 
      effect of neuroticism. The study employed a cross-sectional design with 1011 
      participants, using validated scales to measure insomnia severity, neuroticism, 
      cognitive failures, and mental health indicators. Li et al found that 
      approximately 40% of participants exhibited symptoms of anxiety, depression, and 
      insomnia, with most cases being mild. The results demonstrated that cognitive 
      failures play a mediating role in the relationship between insomnia and both 
      anxiety and depression. Furthermore, neuroticism moderated the relationship 
      between insomnia and cognitive failures, with a stronger effect observed in 
      individuals with lower levels of neuroticism. These findings underscore the 
      importance of considering personality traits and cognitive processes in 
      understanding mental health outcomes. This study emphasizes the critical need for 
      interventions aimed at reducing cognitive failures and enhancing emotional 
      stability to mitigate the impact of insomnia on mental health. Strategies to 
      improve sleep quality, boost cognitive resilience, and regulate emotional 
      responses could significantly enhance individuals' mental well-being. Moreover, 
      integrating personality assessments into mental health services could facilitate 
      more effective and personalized interventions. This article provides an original 
      perspective on the effects of the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic on global 
      mental health. The content of the article addresses the complex relationships 
      between sleep disorders, cognitive function losses, and neuroticism in light of 
      data compiled from existing literature and current research. In addition, how 
      these relationships have deepened during the pandemic and the effectiveness of 
      proposed treatment methods for these phenomena are discussed in comparison with 
      previous studies. The arguments in the article offer new perspectives and 
      suggestions aimed at filling gaps in the literature, and make an important 
      contribution to both clinical practice and public health policies. Li et al's 
      study provides a comprehensive framework for understanding the connections 
      between insomnia, cognitive failures, and neuroticism, as well as their influence 
      on anxiety and depression. The findings offer valuable implications for public 
      health strategies, emphasizing the necessity of holistic approaches to address 
      post-pandemic mental health challenges.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Cervical cancer is a significant health concern among females in 
      perimenopause, with a high prevalence of depression in this population. The 
      rationale for this study was to explore the risk factors associated with 
      depression in patients in perimenopause with cervical cancer. We hypothesized 
      that socioeconomic status, disease characteristics, and quality of life factors 
      contributed to the development of depression in these patients. AIM: To 
      investigate the risk factors associated with depression in patients in 
      perimenopause with cervical cancer. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted 
      on 254 patients in perimenopause with cervical cancer admitted to a single 
      center. Patients were divided into a non-depression group (n = 152) and a 
      depression group (n = 102) based on whether depression occurred after treatment. 
      Data collection included demographic, clinical, and psychosocial factors. The 
      Hamilton Depression Rating Scale was used to assess depression. Logistic 
      regression analysis was performed to identify risk factors. RESULTS: Patients 
      with depression more often had low income (< 4000 China yuan: 66.7% vs 6.6%, P < 
      0.001), initial disease onset (70.6% vs 57.2%, P = 0.001), low social support 
      (70.6% vs 55.3%, P = 0.014), pathological stages III-IV (70.6% vs 41.5%, P < 
      0.001), high pain level (65.7% vs 34.2%, P < 0.001), and poor sleep quality 
      (67.6% vs 32.2%, P < 0.001). Logistic regression identified low income [odds 
      ratio (OR) = 32.606, P < 0.001], initial disease onset (OR = 4.282, P = 0.001), 
      pathological stages III-IV (OR = 4.123, P = 0.0005), high pain level (OR = 1.181, 
      P = 0.0000434), and poor sleep quality (OR = 3.094, P = 0.0041) as key risk 
      factors. CONCLUSION: Low income, initial onset, low support, advanced stages, 
      high pain, and poor sleep quality increased depression risk in patients in 
      perimenopause with cervical cancer. Studies investigating interventions for this 
      population are needed.

TI  - Tizanidine in Postmortem Forensic Cases.
LID - bkaf056 [pii]
LID - 10.1093/jat/bkaf056 [doi]
AB  - Alpha-2 adrenergic receptor agonists are established therapeutic medications that 
      are used for conditions such as hypertension, pain disorders, muscle relaxation, 
      spasticity, opioid withdrawal, insomnia, and sedation. While forensic 
      toxicologists may be familiar with more common alpha receptor agonists, 
      tizanidine is a less frequently identified compound, with limited published data 
      available regarding antemortem and postmortem concentrations. Tizanidine 
      therapeutic concentrations found in plasma are reported in the range of 
      0.0025-0.025 mg/L, although CYP1A2 inhibitors can significantly raise tizanidine 
      levels in the body, thereby increasing the risk of dose-related toxicity. 
      Additionally, imidazoline receptor activity is an underappreciated contributor to 
      the mechanism of action and potential for adverse effects of this drug. Due to 
      its high potency, tizanidine may be missed by forensic laboratories that are not 
      targeting this drug or carefully inspecting untargeted data for its presence. In 
      this study, 18 postmortem cases involving tizanidine are reviewed to improve the 
      understanding of its forensic toxicological profile. These cases have been 
      divided into categories as ruled by the certifying pathologist of ""Suicide"" 
      involving tizanidine (N = 8, mean 6.2 mg/L and median 0.77 mg/L) and ""Accident"" 
      involving tizanidine (N = 4, mean 0.86 mg/L and median 0.89 mg/L), and 
      additionally a category of ""Incidental"" (N = 6, mean 0.35 mg/L and median 
      0.035 mg/L). Comparison of tizanidine concentrations to those in example cases 
      such as this dataset can assist postmortem forensic toxicologists and 
      pathologists in distinguishing therapeutic postmortem concentrations from 
      toxic/lethal concentrations. However, consideration of scene details and totality 
      of case investigation is essential when determining cause and manner of death.

TI  - Interplay of Psychosocial, Clinical and Modulation Mechanisms in Chronic 
      TMD-Related Disability.
LID - 10.1111/joor.70008 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Temporomandibular disorder (TMD) is a multifactorial condition 
      characterised by pain and functional impairment in the orofacial region. Although 
      psychosocial and psychophysical factors significantly influence chronic pain, 
      their combined impact on functional disability remains poorly understood. 
      OBJECTIVES: To investigate the influence of clinical, psychosocial and 
      psychophysical variables on functional disability related to chronic pain in 
      muscular TMD, utilising principal component analysis (PCA) and logistic 
      regression. METHODS: A cross-sectional study with 77 women with painful TMD 
      assessed clinical parameters (pain intensity, frequency, comorbidities and 
      duration), psychosocial characteristics (stress, anxiety, depression, sleep 
      quality and pain catastrophising) and psychophysical assessments (pressure pain 
      threshold, mechanical pain threshold and conditioned pain modulation). PCA 
      identified principal components, which were analysed using logistic regression to 
      evaluate their association with chronic pain grades through the Graded Chronic 
      Pain Scale. RESULTS: Five principal components were identified: psychosocial, 
      clinical pain, duration and extent of pain, pain modulation and sensory. The 
      clinical pain component significantly predicted functional disability across all 
      chronic pain grades (p < 0.05). The psychosocial component was a strong predictor 
      of higher disability levels, whereas the pain modulation component showed a 
      protective effect at the highest disability grade. CONCLUSION: Functional 
      disability in TMD is influenced by a complex interplay of clinical, psychosocial 
      and psychophysical factors. Among five components founded, clinical pain and 
      psychosocial components emerged as the most significant predictors of functional 
      disability, with pain modulation providing a protective role at higher disability 
      levels. This study elucidates the intricate interplay between clinical, 
      psychosocial and psychophysical factors contributing to functional disability in 
      chronic TMD-related pain.

AB  - OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to explore the effects of long-term noise exposure on 
      the mental health and sleep quality of medical staff in an emergency department 
      and noise-coping strategies. METHODS: In this cross-sectional study, 126 
      emergency medical staff (49 doctors and 77 nurses) and 100 medical staff (40 
      doctors and 60 nurses) from the general inpatient department of two hospitals in 
      China were selected as subjects. The research period was from January to October 
      2024. The daytime and night-time noise levels in the emergency department and 
      general inpatient department were collected. The Symptom Checklist-90 (SCL-90) 
      was used to assess the mental health status. The Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
      (PSQI) and polysomnography were used to evaluate sleep quality. Pearson 
      correlation analysis was used to evaluate the correlation amongst variables. 
      RESULTS: The daytime and night-time noise-exposure levels in the emergency 
      department were significantly higher than those in the general inpatient 
      department (P < 0.05). The scores for somatisation, obsessive-compulsive 
      symptoms, depression, anxiety, hostility, terror, psychoticism, PSQI and SCL-90 
      in the emergency department were higher than those in the general inpatient 
      department (P < 0.05). The sleep duration and sleep efficiency of medical staff 
      in the emergency department were significantly lower than those in the general 
      inpatient department. The sleep latency time and awakening time were 
      significantly higher than those in the general inpatient department (P < 0.05). 
      Pearson correlation analysis showed that daytime noise-exposure level was 
      positively correlated with the SCL-90 total score (r = 0.326, P < 0.001) and 
      total PSQI score (r = 0.298, P = 0.021). Meanwhile, the night-time noise-exposure 
      level was positively correlated with the SCL-90 total score (r = 0.435, P < 
      0.001), PSQI total score (r = 0.515, P < 0.001), sleep latency time (r = 0.422, 
      P<0.001) and awakening time of emergency medical staff (r = 0.261, P < 0.001). 
      Night-time noise exposure had negative correlations with sleep duration 
      (r = -0.503, P < 0.001) and sleep efficiency (r = -0.293, P < 0.001).

AB  - Objective This study aimed to explore the effects of noise reduction on the 
      physical and mental state of patients with lumbar disc herniation (LDH) in an 
      orthopedic clinic. METHODS: A retrospective analysis was conducted on 120 
      patients with LDH who received conservative treatment in the orthopedic 
      outpatient clinic of Tsinghua University Hospital from February 2022 to February 
      2023. The orthopedics department underwent noise reduction renovations in August 
      2022 and has implemented noise control management since then. Sixty patients 
      admitted before the renovations were assigned to the conventional group, and 60 
      patients admitted after the renovations were assigned to the noise reduction 
      group. The two groups were compared in terms of noise levels during treatment, 
      subjective negative perceptions of noise, pain level (visual analog scale [VAS] 
      scores), negative emotions (self-rating anxiety scale [SAS] and self-rating 
      depression scale [SDS]], sleep quality (Pittsburgh sleep quality index [PSQI]) 
      and quality of life (36-item short-form health survey [SF-36]) before and after a 
      2-week treatment. RESULTS: Noise level and negative perception of noise in the 
      noise reduction group were significantly lower than those in the conventional 
      group (P < 0.05). After treatment, the noise reduction group had lower VAS, SAS, 
      SDS, and PSQI scores (P < 0.05) but higher a SF-36 score than the conventional 
      group (P < 0.05). CONCLUSION: Noise reduction in an orthopedic clinic can reduce 
      pain levels and negative emotions and improve the sleep quality and quality of 
      life of patients with LDH.

      muscle relaxation on patients with locally advanced gastric cancer (LAGC) 
      undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT). METHODS: A retrospective study 
      was conducted on the medical records of 124 patients with LAGC who received CCRT 
      in Jiaozhou Central Hospital from December 2021 to November 2023. These patients 
      were divided into the conventional care group (n = 65) and the music relaxation 
      group (n = 59) on the basis of different nursing methods. Negative emotions 
      (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]), sleep quality (Self-Rating Scale 
      of Sleep [SRSS]), and quality of life (Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Chinese 
      Cancer Chemotherapy Patients) were compared between the two groups before and 
      after treatment. RESULTS: After treatment, the HADS and SRSS scores of the music 
      relaxation group were significantly lower than those of the conventional care 
      group (P < 0.001), and the Quality-of-Life Questionnaire-Chinese Cancer 
      Chemotherapy Patients scores of the music relaxation group were significantly 
      higher than those of the conventional care group (P < 0.001). CONCLUSION: 
      Music-assisted progressive muscle relaxation can improve the psychological state 
      of patients with LAGC undergoing concurrent radiotherapy, promote sleep quality 
      and help improve quality of life.

TI  - Unobtrusive Sleep Posture Detection Using a Smart Bed Mattress with Optimally 
      Distributed Triaxial Accelerometer Array and Parallel Convolutional 
      Spatiotemporal Network.
LID - 3609 [pii]

AB  - Sleep posture detection is a potentially important component of sleep quality 
      assessment and health monitoring. Accurate identification of sleep postures can 
      offer valuable insights into an individual's sleep patterns, comfort levels, and 
      potential health risks. For example, improper sleep postures may lead to 
      musculoskeletal issues, respiratory disturbances, and even worsen conditions like 
      sleep apnea. Additionally, for long-term bedridden patients, continuous 
      monitoring of sleep postures is essential to prevent pressure ulcers and other 
      complications. Traditional methods for sleep posture detection have several 
      limitations: wearable sensors can disrupt natural sleep and cause discomfort, 
      camera-based systems raise privacy concerns and are sensitive to environmental 
      conditions, and pressure-sensing mats are often complex and costly. To address 
      these issues, we have developed a low-cost non-contact sleeping posture detection 
      system. Our system features eight optimally distributed triaxial accelerometers, 
      providing a comfortable and non-contact front-end data acquisition unit. For 
      sleep posture classification, we employ an improved density peak clustering 
      algorithm that incorporates the K-nearest neighbor mechanism. Additionally, we 
      have constructed a Parallel Convolutional Spatiotemporal Network (PCSN) by 
      integrating Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), 
      and Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory (Bi-LSTM) modules. Experimental results 
      demonstrate that the PCSN can accurately distinguish six sleep postures: prone, 
      supine, left log, left fetus, right log, and right fetus. The average accuracy is 
      98.42%, outperforming most state-of-the-art deep learning models. The PCSN 
      achieves the highest scores across all metrics: 98.64% precision, 98.18% recall, 
      and 98.10% F1 score. The proposed system shows considerable promise in various 
      applications, including sleep studies and the prevention of diseases like 
      pressure ulcers and sleep apnea.

TI  - The Psychological and Physical Benefits of Progressive Muscle Relaxation in 
      Chronic Respiratory Diseases: A Systematic Review.
LID - 10.3390/medicina61061055 [doi]
LID - 1055
AB  - Background and Objectives: Chronic respiratory diseases, such as COPD, cystic 
      fibrosis, and post-COVID-19, are frequently accompanied by psychological distress 
      and physical impairment. As a non-pharmacological intervention, progressive 
      muscle relaxation (PMR) may benefit these patients psychologically and 
      physiologically. This systematic review aimed to evaluate the effects of PMR on 
      anxiety, depression, fatigue, sleep quality, dyspnea, and pulmonary function in 
      patients with COPD, CF, and COVID-19. Materials and Methods: Following PRISMA 
      guidelines, a comprehensive search was conducted across PubMed, Scopus, Web of 
      Science, MEDLINE, Cochrane, SpringerLink, and ClinicalTrials.gov. Eligible 
      studies assessed PMR in adult patients with COPD, CF, or COVID-19. Psychological 
      and physical outcomes were extracted, and methodological quality and risk of bias 
      were evaluated using standardized tools. Results: A total of 32 studies were 
      included in the analysis. PMR was consistently associated with reductions in 
      anxiety, depression, fatigue, and sleep-related distress, particularly in 
      patients with COPD and COVID-19. Some also reported improvements in dyspnea and 
      mild pulmonary function tests, but these were more variable. Only one study 
      evaluated PMR in patients with cystic fibrosis, providing the first clinical data 
      for this group. Interventions were predominantly short-term, with significant 
      variation in design, duration, and methodology, and the risk of bias was often 
      moderate or high. Conclusions: PMR is a helpful strategy in treating chronic 
      respiratory diseases, particularly for reducing psychological distress and 
      improving sleep. However, the evidence is limited by methodological variations 
      and lack of long-term follow-up. Rigorous research is needed to support clinical 
      application, particularly in cystic fibrosis.

TI  - Physical, mental and behavioral health indicators in relation to academic 
      performance in European boys and girls: the I.Family study.
PG  - 2176
LID - 10.1186/s12889-025-23578-3 [doi]
AB  - BACKGROUND: Academic performance in children is associated with a range of 
      health-related factors, including physical fitness, mental well-being, sleep, and 
      behavioral patterns. While previous studies have examined these factors 
      individually, fewer have assessed their independent associations with academic 
      achievement while accounting for other relevant health indicators. This study 
      uses data from the I.Family study to explore how physical, mental, sleep-related, 
      and behavioral health indicators relate to academic achievement among European 
      adolescents, considering each factor's contribution while adjusting for the 
      others. METHODS: We used data from the 2013-2014 wave of the I.Family study to 
      investigate eight health indicators: health related quality of life (HRQoL), body 
      mass index (BMI), diet, media use, physical activity, sleep duration and quality, 
      and stressful life events. Their associations with self-reported academic 
      performance in mathematics and language were analyzed using binary logistic 
      regression models, adjusting for confounders such as parents' education, income, 
      survey country and child's age. We conducted separate analyses for girls and boys 
      to capture associations that are specific to academic subject and sex. RESULTS: A 
      number of significant associations were found between several health indicators 
      and academic performance. Higher HRQoL scores, reduced media time, and increased 
      physical activity were linked to better academic performance in both mathematics 
      and language for both boys and girls. Variation by sex and academic subjects were 
      observed, with lower BMI, higher healthy diet scores and better sleep quality 
      associated with better academic performance in language among girls. For 
      mathematics, emotional, self-esteem, and family-related HRQoL were all 
      significantly associated with higher performance for both boys and girls. In 
      contrast, for language achievement, only family-related HRQoL was significant for 
      both sexes. CONCLUSIONS: Our study underscores the need to consider both the 
      importance of accounting for heterogeneity in sex and the differences between 
      math and language academic subjects when investigating determinants of academic 
      performance, setting the stage for further research on this topic to explore 
      potential competing, synergistic, or time-dependent effects among these different 
      health dimensions.

AB  - Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disorder that affects the central 
      nervous system, causing inflammation and damage to the myelin sheath, leading to 
      balance and gait impairments. Sensory-motor (SN) and virtual reality (VR) 
      interventions have shown promise in addressing these balance issues by engaging 
      all three components of the balance control systems. This study aimed to compare 
      the effectiveness of sensory-motor and virtual reality training on the functional 
      status and quality of life of MS patients. In this study, 36 MS patients 
      receiving Rituximab therapy with an Expanded Disability Status Scale (EDSS) of 2 
      to 6 were randomly assigned to three groups: SN (n = 10), VR (n = 8), and a 
      control group (n = 10). The SN and VR groups underwent 8 weeks of intervention, 
      with 3 sessions per week, while the control group continued routine care. 
      Assessments using the Timed Up and Go (TUG) test, the Timed 25-Foot Walk (T25FW) 
      test, the Multiple Sclerosis Quality of Life 54 Instrument (MSQOL54), and the 
      Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) were conducted at baseline and after 8 
      weeks. Significant within-group improvements were observed in both SN and VR 
      groups for primary outcomes, including the T25FW (P = 0.002 for SN; P = 0.001 for 
      VR) and TUG (P = 0.005 for SN; P = 0.001 for VR), as well as secondary outcomes 
      such as overall (P < 0.001 for both), physical (P < 0.001 for both), and mental 
      (P < 0.001 for both) MSQOL-54 components, and PSQI (P < 0.001 for SN; P = 0.046 
      for VR). However, no significant differences emerged between SN and VR groups for 
      primary outcomes, except for PSQI, which favored SN (P = 0.02). Compared to the 
      control group, the SN group demonstrated significant improvements in primary 
      outcomes-T25FW (P < 0.001) and TUG (P = 0.01)-and secondary outcomes, including 
      overall (P < 0.001), physical (P < 0.001), and mental (P = 0.002) MSQOL-54 
      components, and PSQI (P = 0.007). Similarly, compared to the control group, the 
      VR group demonstrated significant improvements in the T25FW (P = 0.02) and TUG 
      (P = 0.05) tests, as well as in secondary outcomes, including overall 
      (P = 0.005), physical (P = 0.003), and mental (P = 0.01) MSQOL-54 components. 
      However, no significant improvement in PSQI was observed (P = 0.9). This study 
      highlights the significant transformative potential of integrating VR and SN 
      interventions as innovative therapeutic modalities for addressing critical motor 
      impairments, specifically balance and gait, in individuals with MS. By employing 
      task-oriented paradigms, dual-task methodologies, and multisensory frameworks, 
      these interventions not only yield substantial improvements in functional 
      mobility and quality of life but also represent a groundbreaking synthesis of 
      immersive, technology-driven motivation with the pragmatic adaptability of 
      evidence-based SN techniques. Further longitudinal investigations are warranted 
      to delineate their sustained effects, refine their application in broader MS 
      populations, and assess their scalability to establish patient-centered, 
      cost-effective, and outcome-driven neurorehabilitation models.

AB  - Circadian rhythms regulate essential physiological functions, including body 
      temperature and hormone secretion, in a 24-h cycle. These rhythms are 
      synchronized with environmental cues, primarily light, through the 
      suprachiasmatic nucleus. Disruptions, such as jet lag, misalign internal rhythms 
      with external time, leading to fatigue and insomnia. This study explores the 
      potential of dietary sweetening agents as non-pharmacological interventions to 
      facilitate circadian re-entrainment in a mouse jet lag model. Male C57BL/6 mice, 
      maintained on a 12-h light/dark cycle, underwent a 6-h phase advance to simulate 
      jet lag. Mice received drinking water with or without sweeteners (sucrose, 
      sucralose, xylitol, maltitol), and locomotor activity was assessed using 
      wheel-running behavior and intraperitoneally implanted nanotags measuring 
      3dimensional acceleration and body temperature. Sucrose and sucralose 
      significantly accelerated re-entrainment, with phase-shifting rates of 0.93 and 
      1.28 h/d, respectively, compared to 0.76 h/d in controls. Both sweeteners also 
      enhanced post-shift activity, whereas xylitol had a minor effect and maltitol 
      showed no significant impact. Sweeteners did not affect rest duration during the 
      jet lag period. These findings indicate that sweet taste can facilitate circadian 
      adaptation, offering a potential dietary approach to mitigate jet lag symptoms. 
      This study provides insights into how taste perception influences circadian 
      regulation, with implications for managing circadian misalignment in frequent 
      travelers and shift workers.

      treatment of central sleep apnoea with adaptive servo-ventilation.
LID - 2500263 [pii]
LID - 10.1183/13993003.00263-2025 [doi]
AB  - Adaptive servo-ventilation (ASV) has been considered effective in controlling 
      various forms of central sleep apnoea (CSA) and also any additional obstructive 
      sleep apnoea (OSA) component. However, after the publication of the SERVE-HF 
      study, its use was restricted in patients with systolic heart failure and 
      prevalent CSA and was withheld from many patients with symptomatic CSA. In the 
      meantime, the devices have been further developed and the algorithms adapted, and 
      there is new evidence from randomised controlled trials and observational studies 
      that makes it necessary to re-evaluate some societies' statements on the use of 
      ASV, especially in patients with heart failure and CSA and with the current ASV 
      devices. This short statement is based on a review of the effect of ASV on hard 
      cardiovascular endpoints, echocardiographic parameters and exercise capacity as 
      well as on sleep architecture and sleep quality, symptoms and quality of life 
      (QoL) in patients with CHF. The expert group concludes that ASV has positive 
      effects on CSA and quality of life in various forms of CSA that current ASV 
      devices have no negative effect on hard cardiovascular endpoints and that ASV has 
      positive effects on patient-reported outcomes. Moreover, it is used by TF members 
      after optimal treatment of the underlying disease and after an unsuccessful CPAP 
      trial in patients with heart failure with preserved ejection fraction, but also 
      in patients with LVEF 30-45%. In the latter group, however, initiation is 
      performed in expert centres only. In severe systolic heart failure, ASV is 
      sometimes evaluated in a palliative therapy concept for severely symptomatic 
      patients with CSA.

AB  - Insomnia is highly prevalent in clinical practice and can present independently 
      or alongside other medical and mental health disorders. Insomnia is a risk factor 
      for the development and exacerbation of medical and mental health conditions. 
      Behavioral and pharmacological treatments for insomnia are available. In this 
      article, we review important mechanisms associated with insomnia including the 
      hyperarousal model of insomnia and the neurobiology of insomnia. We then review 
      the treatment approaches and management strategies for insomnia including 
      cognitive behavioral therapy for insomnia, transcranial magnetic stimulation, 
      pharmacologic treatment, and adjunctive treatments for insomnia.

      Management, and Future.
PG  - 383-400
LID - 10.1055/a-2605-8706 [doi]
AB  - After experiencing a traumatic brain injury (TBI), the majority of patients will 
      develop sleep-wake disorders (SWD). These can include insomnia, posttraumatic 
      pleiosomnia (increased sleep need), excessive daytime sleepiness (EDS), 
      obstructive and/or central sleep apnea, circadian SWD, and a variety of 
      parasomnias. Untreated SWD may impede the recovery process and can negatively 
      impact mood, metabolic health, cognitive function, and immune function among 
      other processes. Importantly, these patients tend to misperceive their 
      posttraumatic sleep problems. Consequently, interviews performed in standard 
      clinical practice may not sufficiently capture SWD patients, potentially 
      compromising safety and productivity. In this up-to-date review, we outline the 
      state of current TBI-related SWD, highlighting proposed mechanisms, treatment 
      modalities, and areas for further clinical investigation. We discuss data 
      supporting the role of slow wave sleep in the enhancement of neural recovery and 
      strengthening of healthy neural circuits. We also examine the utility of enhanced 
      cohort recruitment and SWD biomarker discovery via the use of social media, smart 
      devices, and data-sharing networks, and call for increased research in the 
      intersection of TBI and SWD.

      Decision Aid in a Pragmatic Nonrandomized Clinical Trial Setting.
PG  - e70127
LID - 10.1111/jsr.70127 [doi]
AB  - Patients with insomnia face difficult decisions when choosing between treatment 
      options with competing risk-benefit profiles. Patient treatment choices were 
      evaluated as part of a pragmatic nonrandomized clinical trial for a two-step 
      cognitive behavioural therapy for insomnia (CBT-I) intervention. Upon enrollment, 
      participants were guided by a patient decision aid (PtDA), outlining the 
      risk-benefit profiles of medication, face-to-face CBT-I (FtFCBT-I), and digital 
      CBT-I (dCBT-I). In Step 1, participants chose between dCBT-I alone, combined 
      dCBT-I plus medication or medication alone. Non-remitters who enrolled into Step 
      2 chose between FtFCBT-I, medication, or no additional treatment. A secondary 
      analysis was conducted evaluating patient treatment choices, the presence of 
      decisional conflict, and the acceptability of the PtDA. In Step 1, 47.4% (n = 73) 
      of participants chose dCBT-I, followed by combined dCBT-I plus medication (42.3% 
      n = 66) and medication alone (9.74%; n = 15). The dCBT-I group was less likely to 
      use medications or used them less frequently compared to the other treatment 
      groups. Men and individuals less motivated to change sleep habits were more 
      likely to choose medication in Step 1. In Step 2, 60.9% (n = 42) of non-remitters 
      chose FtFCBT-I, followed by no additional treatment (23.6%; n = 16) and 
      medication (15.9%; n = 11). Non-remitters from the medication group in Step 1 
      were more likely to choose medication again in Step 2. Over 90% of participants 
      across both treatment steps endorsed the PtDA as acceptable and facilitated their 
      decision-making. This corroborated with the minimal decisional conflict observed, 
      highlighting a potential role in further developing and integrating patient 
      decision aids into practice. Trial Registration: NCT03633305.

TI  - Synthetic cannabinoid withdrawal: A systematic review of case reports.
PG  - 1-17
LID - 10.1159/000546633 [doi]
AB  - INTRODUCTION: Synthetic cannabinoids are novel psychoactive substances with 
      potential for abuse and severe withdrawal symptoms. Despite widespread use, 
      research on withdrawal is limited. We conducted a systematic review of case 
      reports describing SC withdrawal symptoms. METHODS: Literature searches were 
      conducted across databases, including PubMed/Medline, Scopus, EMBASE, and 
      PsycINFO, to identify case reports from inception to March 2025. Eligible studies 
      involved human cases with confirmed SC use and clearly described withdrawal 
      symptoms. Study quality was assessed using the CARE guidelines checklist. 
      RESULTS: N=11 eligible case reports on SC withdrawal identified. Predominantly 
      male (82%), mean age of 28.08 (SD 7.78). Most frequent withdrawal symptoms: 
      psychosis (n=9), agitation/irritability (n=8), nausea/vomiting (n=6), seizures 
      (n=5), tachycardia (n=4), and insomnia (n=3). Rarer effects like delirium, 
      rhabdomyolysis, and auditory/visual hallucinations were also documented. Symptoms 
      emerged within 24-48 hours (62%) and resolved within one week. Case report 
      quality was variable, with an average of 8 out of 13 CARE checklist items 
      reported. CONCLUSION: SC withdrawal manifests with a broad spectrum of 
      physiological and psychological symptoms that can rapidly escalate and require 
      prompt medical management in certain cases. SC withdrawal symptoms are more 
      severe and unpredictable compared to natural cannabinoids, particularly among 
      daily and frequent users. The findings highlight SC withdrawal as an understudied 
      yet clinically important syndrome, necessitating further research to elucidate 
      neurobiological mechanisms and develop evidence-based treatment protocols.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Frozen shoulder (FS) is a common condition that cause high levels of 
      pain and disability. Psychological factors such as anxiety, depression, pain 
      self-efficacy, kinesiophobia, pain catastrophizing and sleep quality may be 
      associated with activity related pain and disability in individuals with FS. 
      OBJECTIVE: To analyze the association of psychological factors and sleep quality 
      with activity related activity-related pain and disability in individuals with 
      FS. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included 96 individuals with FS. 
      Psychological variables included anxiety and depression (Hospital Anxiety and 
      Depression Scale), pain self-efficacy (Pain Self-Efficacy Questionnaire), 
      kinesiophobia (Tampa Scale for Kinesiophobia-11), pain catastrophizing (Pain 
      Catastrophizing Scale), and sleep quality (Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index). 
      Activity-related pain and disability were assessed using the Shoulder Pain and 
      Disability Index (SPADI). Control variables included sex, age, duration of 
      symptoms, type of FS, body mass index (BMI), and presence of comorbidities. 
      Univariate and multiple linear regression analyses were performed. RESULTS: Pain 
      self-efficacy, kinesiophobia, and BMI explained 22.3 % of the variance in 
      disability (f (3.92) = 10.08, p < 0.001, adjusted R(2) = 0.223). Pain 
      self-efficacy and anxiety explained 21.2 % of the variance in activity-related 
      pain (f (2.93) = 13.74, p < 0.001, adjusted R(2) = 0.212). Depression, pain 
      catastrophizing, and sleep quality, as well as other control variables, were not 
      significantly associated with the activity-related pain and disability. 
      CONCLUSION: Higher self-efficacy scores were associated with lower 
      activity-related pain and disability scores, while higher kinesiophobia, anxiety, 
      and BMI scores were associated with worse activity-related pain and disability 
      scores.

AB  - Dual orexin receptor antagonists are known to inhibit the orexinergic signaling 
      pathway, leading to promotion of sleep. Here, we report the pharmacological 
      profiles of 
      [(2S)-2-[3-(5-Fluoropyridin-2-yl)-1H-pyrazol-1-yl]methyl-1,3-oxazinan-3-yl][5-methyl-2-(2H-1,2,3-triazol-2-yl)phenyl]methanone 
      (vornorexant), also known as ORN0829. In in vitro assays, vornorexant exhibited a 
      high affinity for OX(1) and OX(2) receptors, without any meaningful affinity for 
      other receptors, transporters or ion channels, exerting receptor antagonist 
      activity. Vornorexant had pharmacokinetic profiles with a relatively rapid 
      absorption and short half-life, rapidly occupied the OX(1) and OX(2) receptors in 
      the brain of rats after oral administration and rapidly dissociated from these 
      receptors depending on the plasma concentration. In rats, daily oral 
      administration of vornorexant just before the dark phase reduced the sleep onset 
      latency and prolonged sleep time, and no tolerance developed up to 14 days. 
      Vornorexant also reduced the sleep onset latency and prolonged sleep time in rats 
      that had developed tolerance after daily treatment with the GABA(A) receptor 
      modulator, zolpidem. In addition, vornorexant also enhanced the sleep-promoting 
      effects of zolpidem in rats. Moreover, vornorexant did not impair motor 
      coordination in monotherapy and combination with ethanol in rats. These results 
      indicate that vornorexant has desirable profiles with a rapid sleep onset latency 
      and a short half-life, thereby a lowered risk of next-morning residual activity. 
      Vornorexant could be a promising alternative therapeutic option to GABA(A) 
      receptor modulators for the treatment of insomnia. SIGNIFICANCE STATEMENT: 
      Vornorexant is a novel and potent dual orexin receptor antagonist that was 
      demonstrated to exert sleep-promoting effects by occupying the OX(1) and OX(2) 
      receptors in the brain of rats. Moreover, vornorexant promoted sleep even after 
      switching treatment from zolpidem or when administered in combination with 
      zolpidem in rats. These results suggest that vornorexant possesses properties 
      that are desirable for insomnia drugs.

TI  - Effect of chronic benzodiazepine and benzodiazepine receptor agonist use on sleep 
      architecture and brain oscillations in older adults with chronic insomnia.
LID - zsaf168 [pii]

AB  - STUDY OBJECTIVES: Insomnia in older adults is associated with widespread 
      benzodiazepine (BZD) and benzodiazepine receptor agonist (BZRA) use, despite 
      evidence that chronic use disrupts sleep regulation and cognition. Little is 
      known about BZD/BZRA effects on NREM slow oscillations (SO), spindles and their 
      coupling, which is crucial for memory, in older adults. Our objective was to 
      investigate the effects of chronic BZD/BZRA use on sleep macro-architecture, EEG 
      relative power, SO and spindle characteristics and coupling. METHODS: After 
      habituation polysomnography (PSG), second-night data were analyzed from 101 
      participants (66.05 +/- 5.84 years, range: 55-80 years, 73% female) were 
      categorized into three groups: good sleepers (GS, n = 28), individuals with 
      insomnia (INS, n = 26) or individuals with insomnia who chronically use BZD/BZRA 
      (MED, n = 47; diazepam equivalent: 6.1 +/- 3.8 mg per use; >3 nights/week). We 
      performed a comprehensive comparison of sleep architecture, EEG relative 
      spectrum, and associated brain oscillatory activities, focusing on SO and 
      spindles, and their temporal coupling. RESULTS: MED showed disrupted sleep 
      architecture with lower N3 and higher N1 duration and spectral activity, and 
      altered sleep-related brain oscillations synchrony, compared to INS and GS. An 
      exploratory interaction model suggested that chronic use of higher doses (mg per 
      use) correlated with more pronounced disruptions in sleep micro-architecture and 
      EEG spectrum. CONCLUSIONS: Our results suggest that chronic BZD and BZRA use is 
      associated with poorer sleep quality. Such alteration of sleep regulation - at 
      the macro and micro-architectural levels - may contribute to the reported 
      association between BZD/BZRA use and cognitive impairment in older adults.

TI  - The Effect of a Remote Network Technology Supervised Exercise Program Combined 
      With Drug Treatment for Fibromyalgia: Randomized, Single-Blind, Controlled Trial.
PG  - e71624

AB  - BACKGROUND: Fibromyalgia (FM) is a chronic musculoskeletal pain disorder that is 
      seldom reported in China. Recent studies have focused on nondrug treatments, 
      particularly physical therapy, as an alternative to treatments using medication. 
      With the rise of smartphones and mobile communication, mobile health technology 
      has become a significant area of study. OBJECTIVE: This study aims to explore 
      whether using remote network applications to supervise patient exercise, in 
      combination with medication, can improve FM pain. It builds on previous research 
      that focuses on drug treatments and offers insights into individualized exercise 
      therapy for FM. METHODS:  The study used a prospective, randomized controlled 
      design with 80 participants, who were divided into 2 groups: supervised and 
      unsupervised. Both groups received a drug regimen: oral pregabalin (75-150 mg 
      twice daily) and duloxetine (30-60 mg once daily). The supervised group followed 
      exercise routines with guidance from web-based rehabilitation therapist via a 
      remote network application, while the unsupervised group exercised without 
      supervision. The study was blinded to the participants. Primary outcomes were 
      pain levels over the past 24 hours as measured by the Brief Pain Inventory (BPI). 
      Secondary outcomes included pain relief, sleep improvement, quality of life, and 
      adverse event occurrences. Observations were made at the start of treatment (T0), 
      1 month after treatment (T1), and 3 months after treatment (T3). RESULTS: We 
      recruited 80 participants, evenly divided into 2 groups, from August 2022 to 
      December 2023 at West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Comparisons of the 2 
      groups were performed using analysis of variance and Bonferroni post hoc analyses 
      (SPSS version 25 for Windows, P<.05 considered as significant). Compared with T0, 
      the Widespread Pain Index (WPI), symptom severity score (SSS), and BPI (pain on 
      average, least pain in past 24 h, pain right now) scores of the 2 groups of 
      patients with fibromyalgia at T1 were significantly lower. Compared with T0, the 
      WPI, SSS, BPI (pain on average, worst pain in past 24 h, least pain in past 24 h, 
      pain right now), and Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire scores of the 2 groups of 
      patients at T3 were significantly lower. The WPI, SSS, BPI (pain on average, 
      worst pain in past 24 h, pain right now), and Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index 
      scores of the 2 groups at T3 were significantly lower than at T1. However, the 
      significance of some of the data did not exist after Bonferroni correction. The 
      changes in scores from T0 to T1 (T1-T0), from T0 to T3 (T3-T0), and from T1 to T3 
      (T3-T1) in the supervised group were all less statistically significant compared 
      to the unsupervised group. CONCLUSIONS: The study showed that exercise combined 
      with drug therapy can significantly improve the prognosis of FM, including pain 
      relief, better sleep, and better overall quality of life; long-term supervised 
      exercise training is more effective in improving FM symptoms and is safer and 
      more reliable than unsupervised exercise.

PG  - e0325624
LID - 10.1371/journal.pone.0325624 [doi]
LID - e0325624
AB  - BACKGROUND: Atypical Parkinsonian Syndromes (APS) form the third largest group of 
      neurodegenerative disorders including Progressive Supranuclear Palsy (PSP), 
      Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), and Corticobasal Syndrome (CBS). These conditions 
      are characterized by rapid progression, poor prognosis, low survival rates, and 
      limited treatment options. Few studies have suggested that genetic, environmental 
      factors and inflammation contribute to the pathobiology of these complex 
      disorders, however, the etiology of disease and progression remains unclear. 
      METHODS: A multicenter prospective longitudinal (3-time point) study will be 
      conducted with a total sample size of 400 across all the groups (PSP, MSA, CBS). 
      Patients with APS will be recruited after a detailed evaluation by movement 
      disorder specialists and obtaining valid informed consent. The socio-demographic 
      data and whole exome sequencing will be performed only at the baseline. 
      Non-invasive procedures such as neurological and cognitive assessments, sleep 
      quality assessments including polysomnography, brain imaging, and retinal imaging 
      will be conducted at each time point. In addition, gene expressions, methylation 
      patterns, inflammatory cytokines, disease-associated pathological proteins (Tau, 
      pTau-181, alpha-synuclein and beta-amyloid), non-targeted proteomics, skin biopsy, and 
      iPSC will be performed at each time point eventually. The statistical analysis 
      will be performed, followed by the developing of machine learning (ML) models. 
      EXPECTED OUTCOMES AND CONCLUSION: This unique native dataset in APS will enhance 
      our understanding of the molecular mechanisms driving pathological protein 
      aggregation and disease progression. Furthermore, the longitudinal design of the 
      study enables a detailed examination of symptom development, progression, and 
      management. The ML models combined with advanced imaging techniques will aid in 
      early diagnosis, differentiation among APS types, and the development of future 
      clinical trials and treatment strategies.

AB  - BACKGROUND: Shift workers commonly experience insomnia that is associated with 
      various factors such as sex, employment period, dietary behavior, and quality of 
      life (QoL). This study aimed to examine the prevalence of insomnia among 
      shift-working airline mechanics and identify the factors that influence insomnia. 
      METHODS: This cross-sectional, descriptive study aimed to investigate sleep 
      problems, dietary habits, and QoL among 180 airline mechanics and explore the 
      factors that influence sleep problems. FINDINGS: Of the 180 participants, 83 and 
      97 were included in the insomnia and non-insomnia groups, respectively. The 
      dietary behavior score was lower in the insomnia group (28.56 +/- 6.27) than that 
      in the non-insomnia group (31.73 +/- 6.11). The insomnia group had lower QoL scores 
      than those in the non-insomnia group. In the logistic regression analysis, 
      factors related to insomnia were 6 to 9 years of shift work experience 
      (OR = 4.108, p = .042) and physical domain and general health of QoL (OR = 0.506, 
      p < .001; OR = 0.763, p = .027). CONCLUSION/APPLICATION TO PRACTICE: 
      Shift-working airline mechanics with insomnia exhibited lower dietary behavior 
      scores and lower QoL scores than those without insomnia. Considering that 
      insomnia symptoms in maintenance workers can affect aviation safety, effective 
      management is essential. In particular, the risk of insomnia was higher in those 
      with 6 to 9 years of shift work experience. Therefore, airlines should develop 
      protocols aimed at improving dietary behavior and QoL to manage insomnia 
      symptoms. Additionally, closely monitoring insomnia symptoms is crucial for 
      workers with 6 to 9 years of shift work experience.
